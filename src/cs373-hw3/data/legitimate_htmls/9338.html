<li>Fixed pointerstrings for 64-bit</li>
<li>Fixed the addressparser in memview's hexview not handing static 64-bit addresses </li>
<li>Fixed r8 and r9 looking broken in the memoryview window</li>
<li>Fixed hotkeys that set a value as hexadecimal and the value is smaller than 0x10</li>
<li>Fixed multiline string editing for memory records</li>
<li>Fixed dragging cheat tables into CE</li>
<li>Fixed VEH debug for 'Modern' apps</li>
<li>Fixed several translation issues</li>
lua:<br>
<li>fixed getStructureCount, writeRegionToFile, readRegionFromFile, readInteger, ListColum.GetCount</li>
<li>fixed memoryleak in MemoryStream</li>
<br>
Several fixes to DBVM:
<li> added support for Windows 10</li>
<li> support for more than 8 cpu's</li>
<li> support for newer cpu's</li>
<li> fixed issue where calling CPUID right after setting the TF flag wouldn't trigger a breakpoint after it</li>
<br>
<br>
Additions and changes:<br>
<li>Array of Byte's can now deal with nibble's.  (e.g: 9* *0 90 is now a valid input- and scanstring)</li>
<li>The auto assembler can now deal with some mistakes like forgetting to declare a label</li>
<li>Added support to use binutils as assembler and disassembler, and a special scripting language for it</li>
<li>Added support for 64-bit mono, and script support for cases where mono.dll isn't called mono.dll</li>
<li>Added an option to get a list of all recently accessed memory regions. This is useful for the pointerscanner</li>
<li>The pointerscanner can now use multiple snapshots (pointermaps) to do a scan. This basically lets you do a rescan during the first scan, saving your harddisk </li>
<li>Made the pointerscan network scanner a bit easier to use. You can now join and leave a pointerscan session</li>
<li>You can now stop pointerscans and resume them at a later time</li>
<li>Pointerscan files can get converted to and from sqlite database files</li>

<li>The xmplayer has been replaced with mikmod which supports many different module types (in lua you still call it xmplayer)</li>
<li>Rightlicking on "your system supports dbvm" will let you manually load DBVM for each cpu. This is usefull if for some reason your system crashes when it's done too quickly</li>
<li>In "Find what addresses this instruction accesses" you can now open the structure dissect window of your choice in case there are others. It will also fill in the base address, so no need to recalculate yourself</li>
<li>AA command GlobalAlloc now has an optional 3th parameter that lets you specify the prefered region</li>
<li>Added an option to record and undo writes. (Off by default, can be enabled in settings.  Memview ctrl+z will undo the last edit)</li>
<li>Added aobscanregion(name,startaddress,stopaddress,aob)</li>
<br>
lua:
<li>  switched from Lua 5.1 to 5.3    </li>

<li>  added dbk_getPhysicalAddress(int)</li>
<li>  added dbk_writesIgnoreWriteProtection(bool)</li>
<li>  added getWindowList()</li>
<li>  And a bunch of other lua functions. (check out main.lua)</li>

<p><b>March 19 2015:</b>Joining the Twitter fad:</p><p>
Since I'm surprised the Twitter fad still hasn't died out, I decided to join it. Someone already took cheatengine and cheat_engine, so you can go to <a href="https://twitter.com/_cheatengine">@_cheatengine</a> instead.<br>No idea if I'll update it often, but I'll probably use it for new version releases and site updates when needed, and probably some experimental build notifications<br>
</p>

<p><b>August 19 2014:</b>MonoDataCollector update:</p><p>
The mono data collector has been updated with added support for 64-bit targets, and better support for targets that have renamed mono.dll to something else (You'll have to call LaunchMonoDataCollector() or mono_dissect() lua commands manually in those cases)<br>
You can get the updated files <a href="download/monodatacollector.rar">here</a>.  Just extract to the base of the cheat engine folder overwriting the existing files<br>
</p>

<p><b>July 6 2014:</b>DotNetDataCollector update:</p><p>
The dotnet data collector tool has been updated to also gather fields of base classes of the object you're currently investigating.<br>
You can get the updated files <a href="download/DotNetDataCollector.rar">here</a>.  Just overwrite the ones in the cheat engine installation folder with the ones in this archive<br>
<br>

</p><p><b>September 13 2012:</b>forcedinjection plugin</p><p>
Some people have been asking me why they can't use the speedhack in Chrome. That is because the chrome child process has no disk access (Limited user and untrusted mandatory level). It's pretty easy to make it usable again by changing a flag in the config, or just getting a different browser. <br>
But for those that couldn't get it to work, or those that wish to know more about plugins, I've made a plugin for Cheat Engine showing off how to make a hybrid plugin that uses both the lua framework and the exposed plugin api to rewire the injectDLL routine (more specifically, the functions it uses) so that it can force load a dll into the target process without the process having disk access.<br>
<br>
Download link: <a href="/plugins/forcedinjection.rar">forcedinjection.rar</a><br>
How to use:<br>
Extract the files anywhere.<br>
In cheat engine go to settings->plugins<br>
Click add new<br>
Find the plugin .dll for the Cheat Engine version you use. (32 bit: -i386, 64-bit: -x86_64)<br>
Once it is in the list check the checkbox left of it and click ok.<br>
<br>
And if everything went right it's now functional and you should be able to do a speedhack on the target process. One thing to note about this plugin is that when it gets loaded, it will target itself. Even when restarting cheat engine. This is because it needs to rewrite itself. I could have done it without, but it shouldn't be an issue.<br>
For those interested, the sourcecode of this plugin can be found in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cheat-engine/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FCheat%20Engine%2Fplugin%2Fforcedinjection">SVN</a>

<li>Custom types can now do an unknown initial value scan<br></li>
<li>Fixed the auto assembler highlighter from hiding some text while typing<br></li>
<li>Fixed the auto assembler highlighter from not showing hexadecimal values as hex starting with A to F<br></li>
<li>Fixed global debug from crashing in 64-bit (with dbvm)<br></li>
<li>Fixed dbvm from not working on several systems (freeze)<br></li>

<li>Fixed several lua function, including createhotkey<br></li>
<li>Fixed the assembler not dealing well with names with a - in it. (like the tutorial)<br></li>
<br>
<br>
Additions and changes:<br>
<li>Auto assembler scripts can now use the LuaCall(luafunction()) method to call a lua function before the script gets executed
<li>Added a profiler so you can find function entry points and see how often they are called (Ultimap. Requires dbvm. Even in 32-bit)<br></li>
<li>Deleting a plugin now calls FreeLibrary on it<br></li>
<li>Ctrl+enter in the luaengine form now automatically executes the command<br></li>
<li>Added direct 3d hook functions (can be used to show trainers and menu's inside games)<br></li>
<li>d3dhook related: Cheat Engine can now bind the mouse inside the gamewindow for those games that do not support multiple displays, so no more losing focus when moving the mouse<br></li>
<li>Plugins settings between the 32 and 64-bit executable are now seperated<br></li>
<li>Recalculate addresses with only one selection now only updates the siblings and children. Doesn't touch the parent node<br></li>
<li>Addresslist entries can have the notation +xxx and -xxx, which will calculate the address based on the parent address (If the parent address changes, these change automatically<br></li>
<li>The structure dissect has been rewritten from scratch, and the functions have been exposed to lua as well<br></li>
<li>Added a new step to the tutorial (step9) showing how to deal with shared code<br></li>
<li>Made the tutorial translatable as well<br></li>

<li>If you boot up with dbvm you do not need to sign the driver in 64-bit to load it<br></li>
<li>Custom types now support handling as a floating point value<br></li>
<li>Added debug register states to the threadview and made the threadview window capable of changing registers<br></li>
<li>Added remote scanning with ce for different systems. The server just needs to be running, and a 1GBPs network connection or faster is recommended<br></li>
<li>Also added an android server as a proof of concept, but getting a fast enough connection on those connections can be a challange</li>
<li>Changed the add/change address window to be more compact and make dealing with offsets easier<br></li>
<li>Lots of new lua functions<br></li>

Post release fixes (max 7 days after initial release):<br>

<br>
Also, there has been a Mac version under development and it's semi usable. Memory scanning works most of the time and the debugger also kinda works: <a href="http://cheatengine.org/temp/CEMacApril2012.zip">Cheat Engine for Mac Version April 2012</a><br>
You can talk about it in this topic: <a href="http://forum.cheatengine.org/viewtopic.php?t=221190">http://forum.cheatengine.org/viewtopic.php?t=221190</a> or if the mac version becomes more popular I might create a new forum section for it.

It's not only a new version with some new features, but a complete port from Delphi to Freepascal/Lazarus with support for 64-bit<br>
Of course, some features could not get implemented in this new version just yet, like the directx mess and trainer creator, but they are planned to come back in the next versions. If you need to use them, just use Cheat Engine 5.6.1 instead(Check the download page if you need it). And other features have just been stripped because they where useless (hyperscan)<br>
Of course, new stuff has been added like the VEHDebugger, improved pointerscan speed, ability to compare to the values of a saved scan, advanced scripting, etc...etc...etc...<br>

<p><b>January 5 2011:</b>Shortcut to launch Cheat Engine missing:<p>
In case you're noticing that when you start Cheat Engine you get a message that the shortcut isn't valid anymore and Cheat Engine.exe has been deleted from your system then you've become the victim of a really crappy anti virus program. (Really, any anti virus that deletes files without user permission is crap)<br>This is probably also the cause for the "Error Code 2" message during install<br><br>
The solution to this problem is uninstall your anti virus(McAfee in particular) and reboot. Then reinstall Cheat Engine and everything should work fine(perhaps installing a different anti virus as well, as long as it isn't McAfee)<br>
<br>
And if you feel like it please contact that anti virus vendor (e-mail and/or forum) and let them know they should stop deleting Cheat Engine.exe (Even if their forum already has more than 100 topics about it)
<br><br>
also, Cheat engine 6.0 will be out any day now
<br>
<br> 


<p><b>Juli 1 2010:</b>Before I forget:<p>
Because I'm getting flooded with e-mails of people that don't check the forum, if you're using firefox and want to use Cheat Engine on a browser game, then open plugin-container.exe instead of the firefox process. (That process will only exist when the game has already been started)<br><br>
