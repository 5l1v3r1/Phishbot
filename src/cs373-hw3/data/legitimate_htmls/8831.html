<p>Police are investigating the discovery of a human head in a quarry in Cambridgeshire.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zfen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18150" src="http://i2.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zfen.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="zfen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It was found in the small village of Mepal, near Ely, by a staff member at the quarry on Monday afternoon. An unnamed quarry worker has told the Bedfordshire On Sunday news outlet that his colleague found the remains when he took the cover off a skip he had just transported back to the site.</p>
<p>The worker said: &#8220;He took the cover off and spotted something straight away&#8230;&#8221; He went on: &#8220;His first thought was that it was a mannequin&#8217;s head. But then he realised it had eyebrows and hair, and suddenly clicked that it was actually a woman&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said it had blood all over and was covered in dirt, but didn&#8217;t look like it had disintegrated.&#8221; Â The colleague is said to have described the features as looking female and possibly in her thirties or forties.</p>
<p>Police have not confirmed whether the head is from a man or a woman and they have yet to learn how long it had been there. Officers stressed that it was a human head that was found, not a skull. The site is used for landfill, recycling and mixing cement. It is also used for the supply of various materials including limestone and gravel.</p>

<p>The Loose Women panel had to apologise after Katie Price&#8217;s son Harvey swore during a live interview<a href="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zlw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18147" src="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zlw.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="zlw" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>.Katie brought Harvey &#8211; who was born with the rare genetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome and also suffers from autism, ADHD and blindness &#8211; on ITV&#8217;s Loose Women. She hoped it would make trolls think twice before bullying the 13-year-old online.</p>
<p>During the interview, he was asked what he wanted to say to bullies targeting him online, to which he said: &#8220;Hello, you c***.&#8221; Producers were unable to censor the swearing as it was a live show.</p>
<p>Panellist Andrea McClean immediately said: &#8220;We apologise for that. But this is one of the reasons that we wanted to do this live.&#8221; She and Price had explained at the start of the interview that they had been determined to show the chat with Harvey live, rather than arrange a pre-recording. Â Former glamour model Price, 37, said: &#8220;I want people to see what he&#8217;s like, not manufacture and edit what he&#8217;s like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, McClean added: &#8220;We have to apologise, obviously, for the language that you heard a little bit earlier on.</p>

<p>At long last, Harry Styles&#8217;s new haircut has been caught on camera.</p>
<p>Yep, hats off to Harry (literally) as the world has finally seen the singer with his new shorter hairdo after chopping off his infamous flowing locks.</p>
<p>The sighting of the former One Direction star without his trademark ponytail came from the set of his new movie, Christopher Nolan&#8217;s World War 2 thriller Dunkirk; some eagle-eyed fans managed to capture the first image of Harry&#8217;s hair.</p>
<p>The picture was shared on Twitter by Australian DJ Angus O&#8217;Loughlin with the caption: &#8220;There it is ladies and gentleman, the moment the internet broke.&#8221;<a href="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zharr.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18141" src="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zharr.png?resize=300%2C241" alt="zharr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It comes after the founder of charity Little Princess Trust, Wendy Tarplee-Morris, told Holly and Phillip on This Morning that the One Directioner would be donating his recently-cropped locks to their wig-making cause for children.</p>

<p>The London Underground has been crippled after the Northern, Jubilee and Bakerloo lines were all suspended.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zwaterloo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18138" src="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zwaterloo.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="zwaterloo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Huge crowds were building at ticket barriers as Transport for London (TfL) workers fixed a signal failure at Baker Street tube station. Commuters were told to expect delays on their journey into work this morning.</p>
<p>TfL said the entire Jubilee Jubilee line was affected due to signal failure at Baker Street. The Victoria line was facing delays due to a faulty train at Brixton. Passengers on the Victoria line began facing delays just before 8am.</p>
<p>TfL warned commuters at 8.40am not travel to Finchley Road â and tweeted how it had taken them 50 minutes to travel five stops on the Jubilee line. Many commuters to Twitter to vent their anger at the delays.</p>

<p>TWO flights declared on-board emergencies in the air above France within minutes of each other this morning.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zplae.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18135" src="http://i1.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zplae.png?resize=300%2C171" alt="zplae" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A Ryanair flight from Liverpool to Spain and a Germanwings flight from Dusseldorf to Faro were both redirected after sending out an alert. Both planes landed at Bordeaux airport after declaring medical emergencies on board the aircrafts.</p>
<p>Ryanair flight FR9886 issued an in-flight 7700 squawk alert, the code given to an in-air emergency. Germanwings plane 4U9642 issued a similar alert just minutes later. Both planes were redirected after passengers fell ill on board the flight.</p>
<p>A Ryanair spokesman said: &#8220;This flight from Liverpool to Alicante diverted to Bordeaux after a customer became ill on board. The crew called ahead to request medical assistance, the aircraft landed normally and the customer disembarked and was met by medics for further treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aircraft will depart to Alicante shortly and Ryanair apologised to customers for the short delay to their flight.&#8221; The Germanwings flight was also redirected after a male passenger aged between 60 and 70 fell ill with heart problems.</p>

<p>Police have confirmed they&#8217;re concerned for the safety and well-being of Irish singer Sinead O&#8217;Connor after failing to return after a bike ride yesterday.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zsin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18132" src="http://i2.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zsin.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="zsin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>O&#8217;Connor, 49, was last seen on Sunday when she headed out in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette at around 1pm, with police alerted after she failed to return home, TMZ have reported.</p>
<p>Police are said to be actively searching for the star after a friend raised the alarm, with Sinead classified as &#8220;missing suicidal&#8221; the website claims. Yesterday the Nothing Compares To U singer posted a bizarre message to Facebook in which she appeared to hit out at her son Jake, 28 over the custody of another of her three children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake, kindly go to the court on Tuesday and take custody your brother from Tusla. My lawyer will be making the illegal way yourself and Donal got him into Tusla (lying to the cops etc) known to the judge &#8230; What you have done to your brother and your mother is LITERALLY criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinead received medical treatment last NovemberSinead received medical treatment last November Last November the singer sparked concern for her safety after claiming she had taken an &#8220;overdose&#8221; in a post on Facebook.</p>

<p>Britain is in for a scorching summer with hotter-than-usual temperatures for the next three months.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FIST.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18129" src="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FIST.jpg?resize=300%2C203" alt="FIST" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Met Office long-range forecast predicts a 25 per cent chance of &#8216;much higher temperatures&#8217; until the end of July. According to Britain&#8217;s most-anticipated verdict on summer weather highs of around 33C are expected.</p>
<p>The sizzling forecast is good news for Whitsun half-term, The Queen&#8217;s 90th Birthday Parade on June 11, Glastonbury from June 22-26, Wimbledon from June 27 to July 10 and the start of school holidays.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes cut odds of summer being the hottest for over a century to 3/1. A spokesperson said: &#8220;Punters reckon the sunshine will be here all summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The South West was bathed in sunshine and blue skies this weekend as hundreds flocked to the coast to make the most of the weather.</p>

<p>An earthquake measured at 5.6 magnitude has hit off the Japanese coast, just north of Tokyo, Japanese national broadcaster NHK reports.</p>
<p>Local news outlets say the quake was felt in the Saitama and Tokyo areas, with buildings swaying. Metro operations were briefly suspended on all routes in Tokyo and an elevator maintenance firm in Tokyo said several elevators stopped in the metropolitan area due to the quake with commuters asked to âuse emergency buttons,â according to NHK.</p>
<p>TASS news agency reports that books fell from shelves and furniture and walls shook at its headquarters in Tokyo. NHK claims there was panic just after the shocks in the G7 ministerial entourage at hotels where they are staying, with windows shaking.</p>
<p>A 5.6 quake is considered strong according to the Japanese 7-point scale. NHK reports there was no immediate tsunami warning, however. Â Japan Nuclear Power Association says a reactor at Tokai Nuclear Plant in Tokai village has &#8220;suspended operation&#8221; due to the quake. Tokyo Electric Power reports no incidents at the plant.</p>

<p>Benidorm star Tim Healy has been airlifted to a UK hospital following a mystery illness.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zhealz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18123" src="http://i0.wp.com/katm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zhealz.jpg?resize=300%2C169" alt="zhealz" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The 64-year-old actor fell ill while filming the hit ITV show in Spain last month. Over the weekend, his condition had stabilised enough that he could be flown to a hospital in Manchester and he is said to be slowly improving.</p>
<p>A spokesman for ITV said: &#8220;Tim is feeling much better after his spell in hospital and all the Benidorm cast and crew wish him a healthy recovery in his own time. Filming schedules have been adjusted to accommodate Tim&#8217;s absence on screen, the show is currently mid way through filming the new series which will air 2017.&#8221;</p>
<p>Healy, who comes from Newcastle upon Tyne, has played the cross-dressing character of Les/Lesley in Benidorm since 2010. He found fame in 1980s&#8217; Geordie comedy Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, and more recently has appeared as Gastric in Still Open All Hours, opposite Sir David Jason.</p>
<p>He and Welch were married for 24 years before divorcing in 2012. They have two sons, one of whom, Matt Healy is the singer with rock band The 1975.</p>

Detectives described both deaths as âunexplainedâ, adding there was nothing immediately suspicious about the tragedies.</p>
<p>The alarm was raised this afternoon at 4pm after it was reported that the pair had not been seen for a number of days. Post mortem examinations will be carried out on both bodies to establish how they died.</p>
<p>Firefighters wearing oxygen masks were seen entering the property, while National Grid engineers were also at the scene. Â One neighbour said: âWe live a few doors down, but we donât know exactly whatâs gone on</p>
