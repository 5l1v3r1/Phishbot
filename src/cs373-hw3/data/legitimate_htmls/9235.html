What value does that serve anyone? The elections are going to be held and the outcome will be known once the votes are counted. Why would journalists decide that it&#8217;s important for the public to hear their guesses about who will win and lose? One can, I suppose, recognize the value of having a couple of outlets with actual statistical experts offering empirical-based analysis of polling data (although \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/629297012199026688\">Nate Silver&#8217;s\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/blippoblappo/status/727667639347249152\">\u003cem>538\u003c/em> fared\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-media-stop-freaking-out-about-donald-trumps-polls/\">no better\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/nate_silver_said_donald_trump_had_no_shot_where_did_he_go_wrong.html\">when it\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani/status/727668470108835841\">came to Trump\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/podcast-totally-subjective-presidential-odds-early-august-edition/\">in August putting his chances\u003c/a> of winning the nomination at 0 percent, 2 percent, and minus 10 percent), but why do so many political pundits feel a need to spend so much time pronouncing which candidates will or won&#8217;t win?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I asked that question this morning and Matt Yglesias of \u003cem>Vox\u003c/em> &#8212; which offered lots of definitive pronouncements about the 2016 campaign, many hideously wrong &#8212; \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/727827989149437952\">replied\u003c/a>: &#8220;(a) it&#8217;s fun to try (b) people like to read it.&#8221; Both of those claims are probably true (I&#8217;d add: Election predictions are incredibly easy to spout). But that only answers the question of why so many journalists do it, not what the journalistic value is.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There seems to be none, accompanied by at least two significant harms: (1) these predictions create narratives about winners and losers, thus covertly trying to dictate election outcomes under the guise of &#8220;predicting&#8221; them; and (2) there&#8217;s an opportunity cost to all journalistic choices: Flooding the zone with horserace chatter means less time, energy, and resources for substantive coverage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline\">\u003cstrong>Second\u003c/strong>\u003c/span>, pundits who issued such definitive, hubristic certainties &#8212; that turned out to be totally, fundamentally wrong &#8212; owe some self-accounting and a serious self-analysis about how and why they went so wrong. To their credit, some &#8212; such as \u003ca href=\"http://recode.net/2016/03/24/fivethirtyeights-nate-silver-explains-why-he-didnt-see-donald-trump-coming/\">Silver\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/opinion/no-not-trump-not-ever.html\">Brooks\u003c/a> &#8212; have started to do that, but many of them have done little beyond cursory acknowledgements of error, if that. If they really believe that there&#8217;s some sort of value in issuing these prognostications, then there must be even more value in exploring what they failed to comprehend &#8212; especially since they would undoubtedly expect credit as visionaries and oracles if they had been right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline\">\u003cstrong>Third\u003c/strong>\u003c/span>, there are &#8212; and we&#8217;re far from the first ones to note this &#8212; some serious problems in political journalism reflected by this insistent, pervasive belief that Trump could not possibly win (the belief that \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/696394028795850753?lang=en\">Clinton would waltz to the nomination without any serious challenge\u003c/a> reflects a similar problem). Influential journalists live much different lives from the mass of voters on whose behalf they think they can speak &#8212; or, at least, whose thoughts and actions they believe they can anticipate. They also often have different interests, including an inclination to prefer status quo preservation (and to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jakebackpack/status/726047294945107969\">see the status quo more favorably\u003c/a>) than those who have been less rewarded by the status quo. The media class, by and large, is not furious with the political class or with prevailing conditions, and they thus failed to detect the sentiments of anger and anxiety that drove the Trump campaign (and, in some similar ways, the Sanders campaign).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Let&#8217;s acknowledge all the valid caveats: There&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with making predictions, and everyone who tries it is going to be wrong sometimes. Moreover, though \u003ca href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ann-coulter-donald-trump-election-immigration-2015-9\">there were\u003c/a> \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/646106256642437120\">some exceptions\u003c/a>, very few pundits predicted Trump&#8217;s success (though there&#8217;s a huge difference between (a) refraining from predicting or doing so with a tone of uncertainty and (b) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/727820521417617408\">hubristically and condescendingly &#8220;explaining&#8221;\u003c/a> The Truth to the world about what will happen). Many factors, such as Trump&#8217;s celebrity status, made these circumstances unusual. And everyone makes mistakes in every realm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nonetheless, it becomes a much different type of error when one invokes one&#8217;s own claimed authority and expertise when issuing such embarrassingly wrong pronouncements, and, worse still, when the tone used is one of certainty and hubris as though the decrees are being passed down from Mount Sinai. At the very least, when a profession that touts its expertise, collectively, is this wildly wrong about something so significant, more needs to be done than a cursory, superficial acknowledgment of error &#8212; or casting blame on others &#8212; before quickly moving on, in the hope that it&#8217;s all forgotten. Some collective, introspective soul-searching is in order.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cspan style=\"text-decoration: underline\">UPDATE (Thurs.)\u003c/span>: \u003c/strong>Two \u003ci>Slate\u003c/i> articles by Jamelle Bouie were originally included, but one of them was about Trump&#8217;s chances in the general election, and we thus removed it.

According to the National Registry of Exonerations, since 1989 there have been 923 exonerations tied to official misconduct by prosecutors, police, or other government officials,­ 89 of them in cases involving the use of jailhouse snitches. Over the last two years, a scandal involving both has engulfed Orange County, California, exposing systemic violation of defendants’ constitutional rights and calling into question the legality of the prosecution of a number of violent felony cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What makes the Orange County situation particularly troubling is its eerie similarity to another such scandal that unfolded just miles to the north, in Los Angeles County, starting in the late 1970s, and culminated in an exhaustive grand jury report that detailed widespread misuse and abuse of criminal informants and revealed questionable prosecutorial tactics, potentially in more than 200 cases.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Alexandra Natapoff, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and the nation’s leading expert on the use of snitches, said the fact that Orange County officials engaged in unconstitutional behavior similar to what made headlines years earlier in Los Angeles County reveals the “entrenched” nature of the practice of using snitches in questionable ways. “We see it from the outside as a scandal that should not be repeated. But apparently Orange County officials didn&#8217;t see it that way,” she said. “They saw it as business as usual.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The case of Luis Francisco Vega illustrates just how routine the corruption became in Orange County — and how devastating its consequences can be.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed width-auto' style='width:auto'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/santa-ana-jail-5.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-64052\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/santa-ana-jail-5-1024x624.jpg\" alt=\"The Central Men's Jail in Santa Ana, California on Monday, Jan. 25, 2016.\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">The Central Men&#8217;s Jail in Santa Ana, Calif., on Jan. 25, 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Jeff Gritchen/The OC Register/Zumapress\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cbr />\n\u003cspan class=\"dropcap\">O\u003c/span>\u003cu>n a February evening\u003c/u> in 2009, three teenage friends were hanging out next to a parked car on a residential street in Santa Ana, California, when an SUV pulled up next to them. A group of Latino men sat inside the SUV. One of them, sitting just behind the driver, got out of the vehicle and approached the three friends.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Where are you from?” he asked, a coded inquiry into their gang affiliation. “Nowhere,” one of the teenagers replied, according to an account he later gave police. The man then raised his right arm, pointed a gun at the teenagers, and fired. At least five shots rang out. One of the friends bolted and was hit in the forearm; a second, sitting inside the parked car, was hit multiple times, including in the torso and thigh; a third escaped injury. All three survived. As the SUV pulled away with the shooter inside, the teens said they heard a passenger yell a single word: “Delhi” — the name of a Santa Ana street gang.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Speaking to police afterward, none of the teenagers could identify the gunman — they did not recognize him, nor could they provide a physical description. Yet in an interview with Santa Ana Police Detective Andy Alvarez of the department’s gang homicide unit, two of the shooting victims said they could identify one of the passengers in the SUV. He was a 14-year-old kid named Luis Francisco Vega — a former fellow student at nearby Saddleback High School. According to the teens, Vega had “jumped” one of them and beat him up a couple of months prior to the shooting. Notably, Alvarez was told, during that attack Vega had shouted the word “Delhi.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There were plenty of reasons for police to be skeptical. For starters, the victims had a hostile relationship with Vega, giving them a motive to implicate him. Plus the notion that both teens could have recognized a person seated on the far side of the car — in a matter of seconds, while being shot at — seemed farfetched. Neither could describe their attacker, who stood just feet away, nor could they agree on the kind of gun he used, or even the make or color of the SUV. Indeed, while each said Vega was seated on the right side of the car, one witness put him in the front passenger seat while the other said he was in the rear of the vehicle.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then there was the fact that the Santa Ana Police Department, which took pains to document the actions and affiliations of local gang members, possessed no records linking Vega to any gang — let alone Delhi. Alvarez couldn’t prove that Vega was even in Santa Ana at the time of the shooting. Vega’s lawyer argued that he was more than 120 miles from the scene, in Riverside County, where he had been living with an aunt since mid-January.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, that “Delhi” was allegedly yelled in the earlier incident was apparently too coincidental for Alvarez. The detective went out to Riverside County to question Vega in early March 2009. In the course of a 40-minute interview, the 14-year-old insisted he was not a gang member and had nothing to do with the shooting. But it didn’t matter; even if Vega was not the shooter, he was still good for an attempted murder charge, which could send him to prison for life. Vega was arrested, brought back to Orange County, and locked up on a $1 million bond.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the meantime, the cops kept looking for the shooter. Two weeks after Vega’s interview, while the teenager sat in jail, Alvarez’s supervisor, Cpl. David Rondou, sat down with an older youth, 17-year-old Alvaro Sanchez. Sanchez said he’d been “kicking it” with members of the Delhi gang for a couple of months — and admitted that he’d been present on the night of the shooting. That night, he said, he was sitting in the back of the SUV, a stolen Jeep Liberty, when the crew came upon the three teens. Sanchez said he got out of the car because he thought the crews were going to fight. But he claimed he wasn’t the shooter — and refused to provide the names of his companions that night. Sanchez was also charged with attempted murder.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite the relatively weak evidence against Vega, following a preliminary hearing in October 2009, an Orange County judge gave the state the go-ahead to try him for attempted murder.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'>“Orange County law enforcement ruined my child’s life.”\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Less than two weeks later, a jailhouse informant named Juan Calderon came forward with important information. Sanchez had admitted to him that he was guilty of the shooting, Calderon told Santa Ana police and a prosecutor with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office, and Vega had nothing to do with the crime.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Calderon’s claims, if confirmed, would exonerate Vega and thus were required by law to be turned over to his defense attorney. But the prosecutor assigned to Vega’s case, Deputy District Attorney Steven Schriver, declined to do so. Calderon was an informant in a separate case the district attorney’s office was handling; the prosecutor on that case did not want to tip his hand as to Calderon’s activities because to do so might put the inmate at risk for retaliation. Schriver said he didn’t want to release the information unless Calderon was placed in protective custody, but admitted he failed to take any steps to make sure that occurred.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It wasn’t until December 2010, nearly two years after Luis Vega was arrested, that Schriver finally dismissed the charges against him. Orange County prosecutors never took Alvaro Sanchez to trial, instead pleading him out for 16 years on the attempted murder charge. Nor was it acknowledged that the state had held on to the information provided by Calderon for months, knowingly keeping an innocent kid locked up and separated from his school, family, and friends.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Vega’s case might be just another example of the dysfunction that plagues the nation’s prisons and jails. But there is growing evidence to show that he was one of many criminal defendants affected by prosecutors’ malfeasance — part of a much bigger, unfolding scandal pointing to systemic misconduct inside Orange Country, involving not just the DA’s office, but also the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and various local police departments. To date, more than a dozen felony cases involving murder or violent attack have unraveled as a result of the scandal, with charges dismissed or reduced or new trials granted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prosecutors routinely failed to disclose evidence favorable to defendants — so-called \u003cem>Brady\u003c/em> material, named for the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case \u003cem>Brady v. Maryland\u003c/em> — including thousands of pages of notes related to various jailhouse informants. There is also evidence that the OCSD, which runs the county’s jails, employed jailhouse snitches in illegal schemes to compel other detainees to confess their crimes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In Vega’s case, for example, not only did the government delay disclosing the information from Calderon, but it also was holding information from a different jailhouse snitch, Oscar Moriel, which it \u003cem>never\u003c/em> disclosed to Vega’s attorney. Specifically, Moriel had documented a detailed conversation with Alvaro Sanchez wherein the Delhi gang member explained how the Santa Ana shooting went down and confessed that he was one of two shooters. Sanchez expressed bewilderment that Vega had been charged in connection with the crime, according to notes taken by Moriel, saying, “It’s kind of fucked up because this guy [Luis Vega] get’s popped for this case while the three other people who were actually there … were still out there.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If this fact didn’t seem to trouble the DA’s office, it was devastating for Vega and his family. Vega’s mother, Maria Ruiz, said that what happened to her son has been emotionally shattering and “broke” their family. “This has been really hard on him. I am still at this point trying to get him to speak about it,” she wrote in an email to \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> last fall. “It was really hard on our family.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“I never knew how corrupted Orange County was [until] now,” she added. “Orange County law enforcement ruined my child’s life.”\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.5\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center width-fixed' style='width:1000px'>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/sanders.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-63940\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/sanders-1000x647.jpg\" alt=\"SANTA ANA, CA - MARCH 18:  Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders questions a jailhouse informant during a motion hearing in the trial of Scott Dekraai, who is accused of killing eight people in a Seal Beach beauty salon, on March 18, 2014 in Santa Ana, California.

At the end of 2011, Sanders was at work on two high-profile death penalty cases. One was against Daniel Wozniak, accused of killing two people (and dismembering one of them). The second was against Scott Dekraai, responsible for Orange County’s worst-ever mass shooting.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Sanders prepared for Dekraai’s trial, he sought access to files held by prosecutors, including records on a jailhouse informant named Fernando Perez, to whom Dekraai had apparently confessed details about his crime. As it turned out, Perez had also collected a confession from Sanders’s other client, Wozniak. It was an interesting coincidence, Sanders thought, that both of his clients had divulged incriminating information to the same man.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prosecutors fought Sanders’s request for the Perez records, but eventually Judge Thomas Goethals ordered the state to produce them. Upon receiving the file, Sanders and his team were stunned to receive a trove of information — approximately 5,000 pages of discovery materials connected to nine cases in which Perez worked as a snitch for the government.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As Sanders pored over the documents, he discovered that Perez had been used as an informant in a number of prominent gang-related cases. The same was true of another inmate whose name appeared in the records — the prolific Oscar Moriel. Both men were also members of the Mexican Mafia gang. Most damning were notes from Moriel to his government handlers that suggested Orange County sheriff’s deputies had worked with the jail to orchestrate contact between Moriel and other detainees for the purpose of producing inculpating statements.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The arrangement, if true, would run afoul of a decadesold Supreme Court ruling, \u003cem>Massiah v. The United States\u003c/em>, which prohibits government agents, including informants, from questioning or coercing statements from defendants who have already been charged and are represented by counsel. As Sanders looked more closely at the records, he began to wonder: Had law enforcement agents used the same tactics to get Dekraai or Wozniak talking?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sanders also noticed that the amount of material prosecutors disclosed to defense attorneys varied wildly from case to case. In one case involving Perez, just four pages of records related to the snitch had been turned over; in another, some 200 pages had been released. The same was true for cases involving Moriel. “That was a stunner for me,” Sanders told \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The situation strongly suggested that some Orange County prosecutors had deliberately withheld critical information from defense attorneys that could have potentially helped their clients — either by calling into question the tactics that led to confessions or by suggesting that the two informants, each facing serious charges of his own, were working as snitches for personal benefit. That in turn would undermine their credibility, along with the information they claimed to have obtained. Or, as in the case of Luis Vega, the withheld information could demonstrate that a defendant was innocent.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No one argued that Sanders’s client Dekraai was innocent, however. In October 2011, in the midst of a custody battle with his ex-wife, Dekraai walked into the salon where she worked in Seal Beach, California, and opened fire, hitting eight people, seven of whom died. Dekraai then killed an eighth person sitting in a parked car outside the salon. He was quickly captured and arrested. Two days later, Tony Rackauckas, the elected Orange County district attorney, announced that his office would seek the death penalty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Exactly what Dekraai said to Perez has not been made public. But, according to court testimony, in more than 100 hours of recordings that prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies made of the two men talking between their cells, Perez probed for details of Dekraai’s crime. He questioned Dekraai’s state of mind and even asked about what he’d told his lawyers about his case. Dekraai had actually confessed his crime to police just hours after his arrest — though he initially pleaded not guilty in court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Why local officials, including prosecutors, would feel the need to employ a snitch in what would almost certainly be a slam-dunk death case in conservative, law-and-order Orange County is particularly confounding. To Sanders, it points directly to a “win-at-all-costs mentality” that has pervaded the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.5\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed width-auto' style='width:auto'>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/santa-ana-jail-4.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-64017\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/santa-ana-jail-4.jpg\" alt=\"May 24, 2011 - Santa Ana, California, U.S. - Inmates watch television in the day room at the Sheriff's Central Men's Jail Tuesday.

In separate motions, he went further, arguing that his client’s statements were obtained in violation of law and should be suppressed, and that the government’s conduct was so corrupt that the OCDA should be recused from prosecuting the case. (In 2015, Sanders filed a similar 754-page motion in the Wozniak case.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The right to a fair trial is only meaningful when those who prosecute and investigate crimes are committed to both honoring defendants’ constitutional rights and disclosing evidence that is favorable and material, as mandated by state and federal law,” Sanders wrote in the Dekraai motion. “The Court-ordered discovery reveals investigative and discovery practices by the Dekraai prosecution team that are rooted in deception and concealment; an unchecked and lawless … informant program overseen by the OCDA; and a string of prosecutions which confirm a culture that confuses winning with justice — prosecutions marked by repeated and stunning \u003cem>Brady\u003c/em> violations, suborned perjury, and a myriad of other misconduct.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Over the objections of prosecutors, Judge Goethals ordered a hearing. He was “anxious” to hear the evidence and determine “where the truth lies,” he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To say that the OCDA’s office was displeased would be an understatement. Veteran reporter R. Scott Moxley, who has covered criminal justice for the \u003cem>OC Weekly\u003c/em> for two decades, has doggedly pursued the unfolding snitch scandal. He described standing next to a prosecutor when the “bombshell” Dekraai motion arrived in the DA’s office. “He was livid,” Moxley recalled. “The prosecutors, if I summarized it, you know, their position was up front: ‘This is all bullshit.’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The unprecedented hearing, which explored allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to a degree rarely seen, began in March 2014 and stretched into the summer. “As we proceeded, two things were happening in a general view,” Moxley said. “One was that [Sanders] was scoring points in court.” The testimony and evidence were consistently backing up his accusations and the attitude among the prosecutors started to shift. “At first they were really angry,” Moxley said. “And then they were like, ‘Well, OK, some of [the allegations are] right — but our intentions!’” he continued, with mock indignation. “He’s impugning our intentions — and our intentions are noble. It’s all accidental errors.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Over the course of the hearing, Sanders called to testify some 28 prosecutors and law enforcement officers, along with snitches like Perez and Moriel. Much of the testimony was simply incredible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prosecutors called to the stand consistently shifted their stories and minimized their infractions. Sure, there may have been instances of failure to turn over evidence to the defense, they argued, but that’s because they were carrying a heavy caseload. Or because they didn’t fully understand the requirements of the laws they’re bound to uphold — namely \u003cem>Brady \u003c/em>and \u003cem>Massiah\u003c/em>, among the most basic laws governing due process for criminal defendants.

But when the former federal attorney, Terri Flynn-Peister, took the stand that summer, she roundly refuted the accusation. Erik Petersen, a veteran gang prosecutor, also testified that in one case he’d actually been given “an order” not to turn over discovery. When asked who gave the order, Petersen responded, “I don’t know.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At times, prosecutors’ own files belied their insistence that they did not independently withhold important evidence. One memo extracted by Sanders showed an OCDA investigator telling Petersen that information provided by Fernando Perez would “likely greatly enhance” the prosecution of Dekraai; the investigator requested that Petersen not reveal Perez’s name, noting that nothing about the snitch or his work had been revealed to Sanders.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With such shifty behavior exposed in court, the prosecutors’ testimony came across as hardly more believable than that of the informants Perez and Moriel. Although the two men both faced charges that could send them to prison for life, the pair professed to be working as informants not for any personal benefit — like a potential sentence reduction — but simply because it was the right thing to do.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the stand, Perez recalled sitting in a jail cell and thinking about his life. “I … just felt that I was done, done with the [gang] life,” he recalled. So he reached out to deputies with the OCSD’s Special Handling Unit, in charge of the county’s jailhouse informants. Since that day in 2010, Perez said, he’s only told the truth about everything he’s done and heard as an informant. “You know, I’m a changed man,” he explained. “I changed my life around and I did the right thing.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But under intense questioning over three days, Perez’s story unraveled. Although he portrayed himself on the stand as having begun his work with the government in 2010, he ultimately conceded that, yes, he’d acted as an informant prior to his supposed epiphany, and he’d also previously floated the story about being a changed man. Dekraai’s attorneys noted a previous sentence reduction Perez had received as a result of his informant work, a detail Perez claimed not to remember. Still, notes he wrote to his law enforcement handlers after starting his latest stint as an informant were titled “Operation Daylight” — apparently a reference to his hope that his snitch work would result in his freedom.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'>The months of testimony painted a shocking picture of collusion to violate the constitutional rights of jail inmates awaiting trial.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Other elements of Perez’s “work” proved even more troubling. Although he testified that he never cozied up to inmates or tried to get them to open up about their cases (conduct \u003cem>Massiah \u003c/em>forbids), a recorded interview revealed Perez specifically telling prosecutors about asking Dekraai questions in an attempt to get him talking. In correspondence with Orange County law enforcement, Perez mentioned working on his “assignment” and expressed how much he loved “this little job I got.” Another note opened with the line “My mission is complete.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Perez also wrote to deputies suggesting they move an inmate closer to his cell — apparently to gain a better opportunity to speak with him. Moriel, too, engaged in such strategizing; in at least one note to deputies, he invoked a plan to transfer a specific inmate close to him. The plan, which Moriel referred to as the “dis-iso” scam, was simple: Provide a snitch a particular housing classification — in this instance, a disciplinary-isolation placement — to bolster his credibility with other inmates. Because inmates assume snitches would not be placed in disciplinary housing, the move would help to mask his identity as an informant. Then, house the targeted inmate in the same block — within chatting distance of the snitch.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Proof of such maneuvers lent credence to allegations Sanders made about his clients’ cases. That Perez had extracted confessions from both Wozniak and Dekraai indicated that he had been housed near them deliberately, he said. The state denied this charge.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Taken together, the months of testimony painted a shocking picture of collusion between Orange County law enforcement officers and the informants they employed to violate the constitutional rights of jail inmates awaiting trial — in particular, the right to have an attorney present for questioning by the government or its agents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-left width-fixed' style='width:300px'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/judge-Goethals.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignleft wp-image-63997 size-article-medium\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/judge-Goethals-540x371.jpg\" alt=\"Judge Thomas Goethals listens to arguements during a motion hearing in the trial of Scott Dekraai , on March 18, 2014 in Santa Ana, California.\" width=\"540\" height=\"371\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Judge Thomas Goethals listens to arguments during a motion hearing in the trial of Scott Dekraai in Santa Ana, Calif., March 18, 2014.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Mark Boster-Pool/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>In August 2014, Judge Goethals made his ruling. He found that while there had clearly been some inexcusable discovery problems and questionable witness testimony, there was not enough evidence to suggest that the Dekraai case had been tainted by systemic corruption. As a sanction for the violations he did find, Goethals banned Orange County prosecutors from using any of Dekraai’s incriminating snitch-collected statements at trial.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sanders was “tremendously appreciative” that Goethals spent so much time on the hearing, he told \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, but disappointed that the ruling was limited to suppressing the statements\u003cem>.\u003c/em> “Judge Goethals had his reasons — and how could we not be respectful of his reasons?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Nevertheless, Sanders kept probing for additional discovery. That September, he uncovered evidence that the Orange County Sheriff&#8217;s Department — going back more than 20 years — had been documenting and concealing its justification for moving jail inmates. In Dekraai’s case, the documents — known as TRED records — suggested that Perez’s placement next to Dekraai was intentional.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The existence of the records also revealed that at least two witnesses lied at the 2014 hearing: sheriff’s deputies Seth Tunstall and Ben Garcia, both with the Special Handling Unit. On the stand, Tunstall claimed it was not his responsibility to cultivate or manage informants. Both deputies professed to know hardly anything about inmates being moved to facilitate conversations, aside from a few isolated cases, and both denied the existence of records that might confirm Sanders’s allegations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The TRED records revelation persuaded Goethals to reopen the hearing. This time, Tunstall and Garcia had little choice but to change their tune. Tunstall tried claiming he’d simply forgotten about the TRED records during his previous testimony — despite estimating that he’d penned tens of thousands of them over his time with the department. Later, he testified that TRED records are considered confidential, but that he would have answered had he been asked specifically about them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For his part, Garcia testified that he had reviewed TRED records prior to taking the stand in 2014 — they helped determine “who moved who and why” — but, echoing Tunstall, said he failed to mention the records because “that’s the way we were trained.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the close of the hearing, Goethals was so disturbed by the new evidence that he concluded the entire OCDA should be recused from prosecuting Dekraai’s pending death penalty case. On March 12, 2015, he amended his previous ruling — this time agreeing that there were “serious, ongoing discovery violations” in the case. The judge called out Tunstall and Garcia by name for having “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld information,” as well as Petersen, the veteran gang prosecutor, whom he “did not believe.” He also faulted District Attorney Tony Rackauckas for failing to ensure that defendants’ constitutional rights were upheld not only by prosecutors but also by the law enforcement personnel with whom they work in tandem. “Certain aspects of the district attorney’s performance in this case might be described as a comedy of errors but for the fact that it has been so sadly deficient,” Goethals wrote. “There is nothing funny about that.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With the OCDA off the Dekraai trial, Goethals sent the case to the office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris for prosecution. Harris quickly appealed, arguing that the OCDA was unaware the TRED system existed and couldn’t be blamed for problems inside the sheriff’s office. Harris’s office maintained there was no reason to believe the OCDA couldn’t competently handle the case. This claim was particularly notable considering that Theodore Cropley, the deputy attorney general who wrote the appeal, was present in Goethals’s courtroom throughout almost all of the monthslong Dekraai hearing, sitting behind OCDA prosecutors, and was certainly aware of the troubling evidence of misconduct in that office. Yet, none of that information was included in the appeal.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center width-fixed' style='width:1000px'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/tony-rackauckas.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-63988\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/tony-rackauckas-1000x725.jpg\" alt=\"Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas listens to a reporter's question during a press conference, Santa Ana, Cali., March 20, 2013\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas listens to a reporter&#8217;s question during a press conference, Santa Ana, Calif., March 20, 2013.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: H.

Instead of expressing dismay that ethical or legal lapses may have violated the due process rights of countless defendants, those who have spoken publicly have mainly attacked Sanders, both personally and professionally. One prosecutor called him an “imbecile”; another said his legal thinking was daft. A third, Mark Geller, \u003ca href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html\">told\u003c/a> the \u003cem>Orange County Register\u003c/em> that “Sanders shouldn’t even be a lawyer based on the tactics he’s engaged.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prosecutors have also sought to undermine Goethals, who was once a prosecutor in the OCDA as well as a defense attorney. As the \u003cem>Los Angeles Times\u003c/em> reported, since the start of the Dekraai hearings in early 2014, Orange County prosecutors have repeatedly sought to remove their cases from Goethals&#8217;s court. Between February 2014 and March 2015, they sought to disqualify Goethals 57 times based on alleged prejudice — a marked contrast to previous years. Prosecutors sought disqualification only twice in 2013, and not at all in 2012.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In March, the scandal even took a violent turn when a local defense attorney, who recently succeeded in overturning a client’s conviction based on misconduct, was beaten up in the courthouse by an OCDA investigator. The two had exchanged a short but heated set of accusations about who was more “sleazy,” defense lawyers who exposed law enforcement cheating or the county officials responsible for it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Amid the petty sniping (and blows to the defense attorney’s face), fallout from the hearing continues. Even as officials insist that all is right in the house of Rackauckas, at least 15 serious felony cases have so far been directly affected, according to Sanders. Part of the problem is that the cops have gone quiet. In one case, Tunstall and Garcia, the deputies called out for lying in the Dekraai case, refused to testify, invoking their Fifth Amendment rights and thus avoiding cross-examination by defense attorneys.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And yet, more than a year after the deceptive testimony was exposed, neither the attorney general nor the OCDA has filed criminal charges against either deputy — or anyone else connected to the snitch scandal. To date, only Petersen, the prosecutor Goethals singled out for lacking integrity, has resigned his position.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"line-height: 1.5\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right width-fixed' style='width:300px'>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/sandra-hutchens002.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright wp-image-64107 size-article-medium\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/sandra-hutchens002-540x341.jpg\" alt=\"Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens during a press conference, Jan. 27, 2016 - Santa Ana, Cali.\" width=\"540\" height=\"341\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens during a press conference in Santa Ana, Calif., Jan. 27, 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Jeff Gritchen/The OC Register/Zumapress \u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The refusal to hold anyone accountable for the corruption is not just a matter of DA Rackauckas’s nonchalance. Other officials implicated in the scandal have displayed a similar attitude. Sheriff Sandra Hutchens publicly shrugged off the allegations in an extensive interview with a local TV news anchor posted to YouTube in October 2015. Regarding the TRED system, she said the DA’s office had known about those records for years, and the system wasn’t meant to be secret. The deputies who said that were just mistaken — or “unclear” about what they could reveal. She added that judges have said the TRED record itself should be private, but not necessarily the information it contains. In other words, it’s all just a big misunderstanding. “You know, there’s this whole talk of a conspiracy that this is secret information. It’s totally false,” she said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While denying every allegation leveled at her department, Hutchens also admitted that she hasn’t conducted any actual investigation into the matter or addressed the potential perjury by Tunstall and Garcia. She has portrayed herself as being hamstrung while awaiting any comprehensive outside inquiry that might occur. “I can’t do an administrative investigation until that is done. I can’t even get a statement from my deputies,” she lamented. “If they did something wrong, I’ll deal with that. But we don’t know that, to this day.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the Dekraai hearing, Dan Wagner, who oversees the OCDA’s homicide division, said that he and other attorneys looked into the allegations made against the office (an inquiry that was not officially documented) and found nothing amiss — aside from honest \u003cem>Brady\u003c/em> mistakes. Rackauckas, for his part, initially said those errors were the result of an overworked staff, and then four months after the ruling, announced that he would seat a hand-picked panel of lawyers — dubbed the Informant Policies &amp; Practices Evaluation Committee — to review the situation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In an email to \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, a California AG spokesperson said the office was conducting an “independent investigation,” but only “specifically regarding” the Dekraai case.

(The department did not respond to \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s requests for comment.) But in familiar fashion, rather than consider Chemerinsky’s concerns, Rackauckas’s office lashed out at the respected legal scholar. In a press release, the OCDA parsed portions of a law review article Chemerinsky co-authored in 1996 — in the wake of the O.J. Simpson trial — on the subject of legal commentators’ ethical responsibilities. The OCDA essentially took the position that, since he hadn’t been present during the entirety of the Dekraai hearing and hadn’t ordered a full set of transcripts, Chemerinsky should not be speaking out. The DA said the concerns expressed in the letter were based on “factually incorrect media accounts of the circumstances of the case.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Chemerinsky, who spoke to \u003cem>The Intercept \u003c/em>last year about the implications of the snitch scandal, recently declined further comment, noting that he is now representing Orange County’s superior court system, which is fighting the OCDA over its retaliatory actions against Goethals. In a court filing, the county’s supervising felony judge wrote that the DA’s conduct toward Goethels has jeopardized “all felony cases” in Orange County by bottlenecking the system.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>If Rackauckas hoped his informant committee would clear the DA’s office, its investigation did no such thing. The committee completed its report in December, noting that where the use of informants is concerned, confidence in the criminal justice system in Orange County “has eroded.” The report criticized the “win-at-all-costs mentality” among some prosecutors, describing the office as a “ship without a rudder.” Among the recommendations: The OCDA should revise its policies for using informants and ensure better supervision of related cases; provide more robust training for prosecutors; and establish a conviction integrity unit to review post-conviction innocence claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the committee also emphasized that its review was incomplete. Lacking subpoena power, it had access only to whatever materials officials voluntarily turned over, and it could not force anyone to talk. The review should be considered an “evaluation,” not an “investigation,” the committee wrote, and concluded that an outside “entity with document subpoena power and the ability to compel witnesses to be questioned under oath” should conduct a full inquiry. In short, the committee had come to nearly the same conclusion as Chemerinsky, whose opinion the DA had flatly dismissed.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the wake of the report, Rackauckas finally submitted his own investigation request to the DOJ, although his appearance at a press conference around the same time suggested that he remains unconvinced it is actually needed. “We know there is no evidence whatsoever of any of this sensational wrongdoing that’s been alleged,” Rackauckas said bluntly. “There’s been some mistakes made,” particularly with meeting evidence discovery obligations, but there were “no innocent people” convicted as a result and “no injustice,” he added. “We know that doesn’t exist.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How exactly Rackauckas can be so sure is a mystery. With a scandal of such proportions, it’s impossible to draw conclusions about possible miscarriage of justice absent a concerted effort to identify and review every case that may have been tainted by violations of due process. Orange County is littered with victims of the scandal — from the grieving families of Dekraai’s victims, who have yet to see justice of any kind, to Luis Vega, now 22, who was locked up at 14 for a crime he almost certainly did not commit.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It might be one thing if the law enforcement officials involved had never navigated a scandal of such scope. But Rackauckas and Sheriff Hutchens should be more familiar with the process than most. Both were working in the criminal justice system in Southern California when the last big snitch controversy, in Los Angeles County, erupted in the state. Rackauckas had joined the OCDA and Hutchens was working in the L.A. County jail system — ground zero for the scandal. According to a sheriff’s department spokesperson, Hutchens was a junior jailer at the time and didn’t work at the men’s jail where the scandal unfolded. The OCDA declined to comment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-center'>“Our criminal justice system is much better at looking forward than backward.”\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>The corruption in L.A. County was uncovered after a career criminal named Leslie White explained to the press and local sheriff’s department how he cooked up detailed false confessions that he then peddled to jailers as having come from fellow inmates. The ensuing grand jury investigation involved testimony from more than 100 witnesses and thousands of documents. In its report, the 1989-1990 grand jury concluded, in part, that a number of informants had committed perjury, the DA’s office had deliberately failed to curtail misuse of informants, and the sheriff’s office had violated defendants’ rights. The report estimated that over a 10-year period, as many as 250 cases involving informants were affected.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The grand jury report noted that convicted defendants could raise wrongful conviction claims based on the county’s use of jailhouse informants — but it isn’t clear how many claims were ever raised on those grounds. Today, the number of cases that may have been tainted by Orange County’s scandal is similarly unclear. Whether such a figure will ever be known — or whether affected defendants will have a meaningful chance to challenge their convictions — will depend on a thorough and independent investigation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Responding to questions about the scandal, an OCDA spokesperson declined to provide any answers, stating that \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> was requesting an “exorbitant amount of information” that would “require a lot of time and resources” to address. “Your questions show a slanted bias and our participation appears to solely serve as a filler. We don’t believe you’re interested in being fair,” the response reads. “We respectfully decline to participate in your article.” Indeed, the OCDA has consistently argued that the media have overblown resolvable discovery problems and that any systemic issues resided in the sheriff’s department.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Still, it doesn’t appear the scandal will recede into the background any time soon. In a court hearing last week related to Sanders’s other capital client, Daniel Wozniak, sheriff’s department officials testified that they’d found yet another trove of documents — computer notes related to jailhouse informants that were taken by Ben Garcia and other deputies — that has never been turned over to the defense, or, apparently, to prosecutors. According to the \u003cem>Orange County Register\u003c/em>, officials testified that the OCSD administration had no idea deputies were keeping the notes, which span at least a five-year period beginning in 2008. The OCDA quickly issued a press release condemning the sheriff’s department.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Our criminal justice system is much better at looking forward than backward,” Laura Fernandez, a lawyer and fellow at Yale researching prosecutorial misconduct, wrote to \u003cem>The Intercept. \u003c/em>Fernandez, who signed Chemerinsky’s letter to the DOJ, said that outside of death penalty cases (which have built-in layers of post-conviction review), legislation and the expansion of certain legal doctrines have made “reviewing cases progressively more difficult.” Yet the kind of misconduct that’s surfaced in Orange County shows precisely why identifying and reviewing all potentially impacted cases is so crucial. “Where there is substantial evidence of concealment, distortion, and even outright deception on the part of the state, as there is here, reevaluating tainted cases is not only possible, but critically important.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>What is abundantly clear about the situation in Orange County is that if it weren’t for a handful of people — chiefly, public defender Sanders, Judge Goethals, and reporter Moxley — the snitch scandal probably would not have made news outside the courthouse in Santa Ana.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Indeed, as the scandal began to unfold, Moxley recalls being pulled aside in the courthouse by a veteran Orange County prosecutor, who suggested that he back off the story. “He goes, ‘You know, if you turn away from this, this goes away,’” Moxley said. “And he wasn’t saying that as a compliment. He was saying, ‘You’re inflating this. If you leave it, then it’s just Sanders barking in a courtroom.’ And it stunned me, because it was early on, and I thought, wow, this is how they’re viewing it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For Maria Ruiz, the mother of Luis Vega, who at 14 was jailed for nearly two years for a crime that county law enforcement knew he did not commit, that sort of flippancy isn’t new. Indeed, it wasn’t until last year that Ruiz learned police and prosecutors had evidence in hand that her son was actually innocent months before the attempted murder charge against him was finally dropped. “I was so emotional” after finding out, she said. “I was crying for the whole month.” She always knew her son was innocent — and early on, she told the prosecutor just that. “I told the DA, ‘Look, you have the wrong person.’ And he just shook his head at me.”\u003c/p>\n","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/14/orange-county-scandal-jailhouse-informants/","thumbnail":{"ID":63943,"title":"Jails Could Fill as California Reduces Prison Population","excerpt":"Inmates make collect phone calls at the Men's Central Jail in Santa Ana, Cali., May 24, 2011.

So unlike impeachment in most other countries with a presidential system, impeachment here will empower a person from a different party than that of the elected president.

Dilma, in many critical ways, has been a failed president, and she is deeply unpopular. They have often aligned with and served the country&#8217;s elite \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/how-brazils-ruling-workers-party-lost-the-workers/2016/04/24/1b8f02f6-0358-11e6-8bb1-f124a43f84dc_story.html\">at the expense of their base of poor supporters\u003c/a>.

Whatever damage PT is doing to Brazil, the plutocrats and their journalist-propagandists and the band of thieves in Brasilia engineering this travesty are far more dangerous. They are literally dismantling &#8212; crushing &#8212; democracy in the world&#8217;s fifth-largest country. Even \u003cem>The Economist \u003c/em>&#8212; which is hostile to even the most moderate left-wing parties, hates PT, and wants Dilma to resign &#8212; has \u003ca href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21695391-tarnished-president-should-now-resign-time-go\">denounced impeachment\u003c/a> as &#8220;a pretext for ousting an unpopular president&#8221; and \u003ca href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21697226-dilma-rousseff-has-let-her-country-down-so-has-entire-political-class-great?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/thegreatbetrayal\">just two weeks ago warned\u003c/a> that &#8220;what is alarming is that those who are working for her removal are in many ways worse.&#8221; Before he became an active plotter in his own empowerment, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelTemer/status/582413077754195968\">Temer himself said\u003c/a> last year that &#8220;impeachment is unthinkable, would create an institutional crisis. There is no judicial or political basis for it.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest scam of all is that Brazilian media elites are justifying all of this in the name of &#8220;corruption&#8221; and &#8220;democracy.&#8221; How can anyone who is minimally rational believe this is about &#8220;corruption&#8221; when they&#8217;re about to install as president someone far more implicated in corruption than the person they&#8217;re removing, and when the factions to be empowered are corrupt beyond what can be described? And if they were really concerned with &#8220;democracy,&#8221; why wouldn&#8217;t they also impeach Temer and hold new elections, \u003ca href=\"http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/opinion/2016/04/1757991-opinion-if-impeachment-then-who.shtml\">letting voters decide who should replace Dilma\u003c/a>? The answer is obvious: New elections would almost certainly result in a victory \u003ca href=\"http://folhadecondeuba.com.br/lula-tem-21-marina-19-aecio-17-diz-pesquisa-datafolha/\">for Lula or other candidates they dislike\u003c/a>, so what they fear most is letting the Brazilian population decide who will govern them. \u003cem>That\u003c/em> is the very definition of the destruction of democracy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond obvious global significance, the reason I&#8217;ve spent so much time and energy writing about these events is because it&#8217;s been astonishing &#8212; and unnerving &#8212; to watch it all unfold, particularly given how the country&#8217;s dominant media, owned by a tiny handful of rich families, allow almost no plurality of opinion. Instead, as Reporters Without Borders \u003ca href=\"https://rsf.org/en/news/brazil-falls-press-freedom-index-now-104th\">put it earlier this month\u003c/a>: &#8220;In a barely veiled manner, the leading national media have urged the public to help bring down President Dilma Rousseff. The journalists working for these media groups are clearly subject to the influence of private and partisan interests, and these permanent conflicts of interests are clearly very detrimental to the quality of their reporting.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As someone who has lived in Brazil for 11 years, it&#8217;s been inspiring and invigorating to watch a country of 200 million people throw off the shackles of a 21-year-old right-wing (U.S./U.K. supported) military dictatorship and mature into a young, vibrant democracy and then thrive under it. To see how quickly and easily that can be reversed &#8212; abolished in all but name only &#8212; is both sad and frightening to watch. It&#8217;s also an important lesson for those, in countries all over the world, who blithely assume that things will continue as is or that they&#8217;re guaranteed stability and ongoing progress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last week, I spoke to \u003cem>Democracy Now\u003c/em> for about 10 minutes on why I think these developments in Brazil are so significant:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003ciframe width='100%' height='400px' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/N1csqcTvU9Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>\u003c/iframe>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/brazils-democracy-to-suffer-grievous-blow-today-as-unelectable-corrupt-neoliberal-is-installed/","thumbnail":{"ID":64694,"title":"Brazilian Vice President Michel Temer during a meeting with parliamentary delegation from Kuwait","excerpt":"Photo: Dida Sampaio/ Agencia Estado via AP","content":"","credit":"","sizes":{"feature_hero":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-feature-hero.jpg","width":1200,"height":800},"promo":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-promo.jpg","width":440,"height":220},"promo_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-promo-large.jpg","width":900,"height":450},"top_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-top-large.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"top_small":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-top-small.jpg","width":200,"height":200},"square":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-440x440.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"article_header":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer-article-header.jpg","width":1440,"height":720},"original":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/Michel-Temer.jpg","width":"1440","height":"720"}}},"date":"2016-05-11T13:48:36+00:00","authors":[{"ID":7,"display_name":"Glenn Greenwald","url":"https://theintercept.com/staff/glenn-greenwald/","brief_bio":"Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, constitutional lawyer, and author of four \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em> best-selling books on politics and law.","full_bio":"\u003cp>Glenn Greenwald is one of three co-founding editors of The Intercept.

Record management officers were given guidance on how to preserve records from the operation, and the general staff was told how to preserve even “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829974-documenting-your-contribution-during-the-iraq/\">seemingly mundane things\u003c/a>.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Soon after the president’s “Mission Accomplished” victory speech, some NSA staff returned from deployment. But the role of signals intelligence in Iraq was not over. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830086-king-of-diamonds-apprehended-in-iraq/\">The NSA provided “time-sensitive SIGINT” support\u003c/a>, including a “summary of contacts,” to aid the May 22, 2003, capture of a top Baathist official, Aziz Sajih Al-Numan, “king of diamonds” in the deck of playing cards that featured U.S. Central Command’s wanted Iraqis.

But that wasn’t the only time the agency influenced diplomacy: In 2002, signals intelligence ignited a confrontation between North Korea and the U.S., according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829973-uncovering-north-korea-nuclear-programs/\">a \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>article from April 2003\u003c/a>. NSA eavesdroppers discovered that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment capability in violation of an agreement with the U.S. When the State Department presented the evidence at a meeting in Pyongyang that October, the North Koreans admitted it was true, the article said, setting off the clash.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The ONLY source of information on this treaty violation was SIGINT derived from North Korean external communications,” an NSA manager wrote in \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>. “This is both a SIGINT success story and an example of how cross-organizational collaboration can produce key intelligence. Hats off to everyone involved!”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Orbital Signals Intelligence\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>For more than 30 years, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830054-new-release-the-fornsat-plan/\">one \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article from June 2003 explained\u003c/a>, the NSA had tapped into communications from foreign satellites. Though the program associated with this monitoring, FORNSAT, has been previously \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/primary-fornsat-collection-operations\">disclosed\u003c/a>, this document adds important context. For example, it made FORNSAT sound like an intelligence gold mine, having “consistently provided … over 25 percent of end product reporting.” It also explained what sorts of information the NSA gleaned from satellites — “intelligence derived from diplomatic communications … airline reservations and billing data … traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction … international finance and trade.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem, at the time the article was written, was that FORNSAT was in “dire need of upgrade” because it was “primarily engineered for voice” communications and needed to shift to intercepting more digital communications, including digital video. It also needed to be expanded to tap into mobile satellite phone systems, which “use hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access.”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Leaks Included in 5,000 “Insecurity Records”\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Ten years before Edward Snowden gave a trove of NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, a “chief” within SID’s Communications and Support Operations organization \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829987-profile-intelligence-security-issues/\">described in \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> the great lengths the agency went to in order to track leaks\u003c/a>. In a profile of the Intelligence Security Issues office within CSO, this person said that ISI scanned 350 press items daily for “cryptologic insecurities” and maintained a database called FIRSTFRUIT with “over 5,000 insecurity-related records” ranging from “espionage damage assessments” to “liaison exchanges.” This ISI profile ran as part of a broader \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=communications-and-support-operations-cso#archive\">series on the CSO organization\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Technology Pushed NSA Into the Tablet Era — and Tons of Gear Went Missing\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>One theme that emerges from early 2003 \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>installments is that the NSA was grappling with how to handle advances in information technology, particularly the proliferation of mobile devices and online networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One article in the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">“Customer Relations” series\u003c/a> described several “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">dynamic dissemination products\u003c/a>” to help SID “change with … our customers,” including an initiative to distribute “secret-level information” to wireless devices, a technique for disseminating “NSA product” to tablet computers, and a system to view secret documents on unclassified computers over the internet, bypassing the need for a high-security enclosed area known as a SCIF. These efforts foreshadowed Hillary Clinton’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/how-clintons-email-scandal-took-root/2016/03/27/ee301168-e162-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html\">controversial\u003c/a> use, as secretary of state, of a BlackBerry device to traffic in sensitive government information after the NSA reportedly rebuffed her request for a special secure device from the agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830027-sid-property-inventory-starts-next-week/\">Another article\u003c/a> highlighted that the NSA was a heavy user of mobile devices even four years before the release of the first iPhone, calling on staffers to help catalogue all computers, including “laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc.,” for an annual inventory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The document also stated that $27 million worth of equipment remained “unaccounted for” after the prior year’s audit, which ended just two months earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In addition to making secret information accessible to more people, SID was developing new systems to solve long-standing problems. The JOURNEYMAN program, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830013-what-is-journeyman/\">described in another article\u003c/a>, aimed to develop a system for distributing SIGINT reports to many different recipients at once across different networks with different formatting requirements. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830069-patenthammer/\">Another system, PATENTHAMMER\u003c/a>, collected cellular, fax, and pager signals for the Special Operations Command and also allowed users to access information collected in the past.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SID was also still exploring the rapidly evolving internet. One article described how the NSA was improving its integration with the public internet via a program \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830068-outparks-a-new-internet-for-nsa/\">called OUTPARKS\u003c/a>. Another \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830032-sigint-development-2003-conference/\">touted\u003c/a> the NSA’s annual SIGDEV conference, a major event \u003ca href=\"https://niccs.us-cert.gov/news-events/nsa-sigint-development-conference-2015\">in which\u003c/a> analysts from the “\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes\">five eyes\u003c/a>” intelligence agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States share techniques for developing new SIGINT. The article noted that the 2003 SIGDEV would include workshops on “social network analysis,” “internet research,” and “wireless LANs,” that is, wifi networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Other NSA staff apparently required more basic forms of training. “Do you know you can make \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> your browser homepage?” asked \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830087-makin-it-easy/\">a June 2003 article\u003c/a>, with instructions on changing the default homepage in the web browsers popular at the time: Netscape and Internet Explorer.\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center width-fixed' style='width:1000px'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/world-trade-center-9-11.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-large wp-image-65085\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/world-trade-center-9-11-1000x1000.jpg\" alt=\"world-trade-center-9-11\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Sept. 12, 2001, shows an area of white dust and smoke at the location where the 1,350-foot towers of the World Trade Center once stood in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Spaceimaging.com/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Demand for NSA Intelligence Became “Voracious”\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>The Signals Intelligence Directorate is full of expert spies, but they don’t choose who to spy on themselves. In the corporate lingo of SID, the “customer” decides, customers “including all departments of the executive branch,” according to the agency’s \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092433/https:/www.nsa.gov/sigint/\">website\u003c/a>. And the demand from customers exploded in 2003, judging from a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">series of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles about the Customer Relationships Directorate\u003c/a>, an office focused on ensuring that NSA’s customers get what they need.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One driver of this demand was the war on terror; inbound SIGINT requests to the NSA’s National Security Operations Center went from 300 in the two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks to 1,700 by the end of the year, according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829985-information-needs-management-careful-planning/\">one \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article\u003c/a>. Existing customers like the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture “suddenly became voracious consumers” of signals intelligence, as \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">one article from April 2003 \u003c/a>put it, and brand new customers appeared on the scene, such as the newly created Department of Homeland Security. SID also increased its interaction with domestic law enforcement agencies like the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another driver of heightened SIGINT demand was the war in Iraq. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829994-a-perspective-on-the-nsa-usun-partnership/\">document\u003c/a> describing the NSA’s role in war-related U.N.

As part of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>’s explainer series “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=consider-this#archive\">ConSIDer This\u003c/a>,” one unknown author from the SIGINT communications team \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830106-consider-this-what-does-it-mean-to-downgrade/\">explained how to lower the classification level\u003c/a> of intercepted communications, or COMINT, a process known as “downgrading.” The process could involve some subterfuge. “In order to downgrade COMINT, a plausible cover (i.e., collection from a less sensitive source) must exist,” the article stated.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Changing of the Guard at SID\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>As \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> launched in 2003, the Signals Intelligence Directorate was in the midst of a leadership change as Director Maureen Baginski \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829965-sid-leadership-transition-passing-the-baton/\">moved to a new position\u003c/a> as the FBI’s head of intelligence and Maj.

Although much of its content is unclassified and often appears largely designed to burnish the agency’s self-image, \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> also includes more revelatory sections that are officially “secret” and “top secret.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our initial goal was to release in one batch the first three months of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>, starting at the end of March 2003, as well as all 2003 installments of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article series that began during this period.

This means \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles, as provided by Snowden, were in Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, the native format of the web. To be fully readable, most webpages require HTML files as well as associated images, stylesheets, and other files, but unfortunately those other elements were not included in the Snowden archive. This meant the original webpages looked rather chaotic when viewed in a web browser. They also included broken links to the internal NSA network.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Staff technologist Micah Lee prepared software that parsed the original \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> HTML files and extracted the usable content. This content was then placed into a template with minimalist design and converted to PDF format. PDF files, unlike HTML files, could be edited by multiple staffers using widely available, easy-to-use software tools with native redaction facilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The PDF files don&#8217;t look the same way the original \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> website looked — they don&#8217;t use the original layout or style elements — but they do contain the same text content. They also include the original clip art-style \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> logo.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Research and Redaction\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Once the files were formatted, Research Editor for Investigations Margot Williams combed through each article, doing several things at once: identifying names that we might need to redact, researching those individuals to see what was publicly known about them, summarizing the document, and looking for material that could be the basis of stories for \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In keeping with \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s editorial standards, we redacted the names of covert agents and the names and contact information of government personnel who are neither high-ranking nor already publicly associated with the NSA. We also removed information if we believed its release could cause serious injury or death to innocent people.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After Williams reviewed each article, the article was reviewed again by Lee, by a senior editor, and by our legal counsel. Redacted articles were also shown to the NSA, which was offered a chance to respond, resulting in the redaction of two additional names.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Writing and Publishing\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s examination of this first batch of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> content yielded an \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">article on the NSA’s involvement with interrogations at Guantánamo Bay\u003c/a> as well as a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">“highlights reel” summarizing insights gleaned from the material\u003c/a> that struck us as most relevant for our readers.

Its \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829956-the-analyst-cockpit/\">inaugural article\u003c/a> blandly described what it called “the analyst cockpit,” a portal for intelligence experts to access their data.

Some articles were firsthand descriptions of important missions, as in the case of an NSA employee who went to Baghdad right after the Iraqi capital came under American control. “I rode the whole way in a five-ton truck, with easy access to thermite grenades that could be used to destroy our classified cargo in the event of an ambush,” he \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830628-2003-12-05-SIDToday-Camp-Virginia-to-Camp.html\">wrote\u003c/a> at the end of 2003.

One column, called “Ask Zelda!,” was akin to “Dear Abby” for the intelligence community, written by a mid-level supervisor at the NSA who answered questions from readers, including one about what should be worn to the office on hot summer days. “Shorts and flip-flops don’t exactly convey the image of a fierce SIGINT warrior,” Zelda \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1059979-is-bain-de-soleil-a-bane-on-nsa.html\">noted\u003c/a>. Another column, “SIGINT Philosopher,” delved into the ethics of surveillance (reliably coming out on the favorable side) and was written by a language analyst who described a personal epiphany that came during a polygraph exam. “Signal v. Noise” explored the difficulties involved in collecting large amounts of data, while “SIGINT Curmudgeon” was written by a longtimer who waxed nostalgic about the good old days of eavesdropping. (None of these columns were up and running in the initial batch of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">just released\u003c/a> by \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, but I have written previously \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/07/nsa-advice-columnist-seriously/\">about “Ask Zelda!”\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/surveillance-philosopher-nsa/\">the “SIGINT Philosopher\u003c/a>.” In both cases, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> simultaneously published copies of the original columns.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the cultural revelations in the archives of \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>is the corporate language that was routinely used. Intelligence reports delivered to other government agencies were described as “products,” and there was a category called the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830623-2009-08-05-SIDToday-Does-NSA-Look-Different-From.html\">Counterterrorism Product Line\u003c/a>.” Government agencies that received these reports were known as “customers,” and the NSA has an entire division called the “Customer Relationship Directorate.” One of the \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles published today was titled “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">Dynamic Methods of Interaction With New and Existing Customers\u003c/a>,” and it referred to “product line leaders” at the agency who created “customer support plans” that included details on what “each customer needs.” The customers mentioned in the article included the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Missile Defense Agency, and Federal Reserve. The article was written by an official whose title was “acting chief, customer gateway.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles also convey what officials at the agency were reading in their off-hours. Some articles included references to popular authors like the travel writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830626-2010-04-30-SIDToday-Learning-to-Love-English.html\">Bill Bryson\u003c/a>, the \u003cem>New Yorker\u003c/em> writer Malcolm Gladwell, and mid-century economist Herbert Simon. One of the articles released today was an \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830090-book-review-cryptonomicon/\">enthusiastic review\u003c/a> of the Neal Stephenson sci-fi novel \u003cem>Cryptonomicon\u003c/em>, which was described in the article (written by a member of the communications team in the Signals Intelligence Directorate) as “an enthralling work that proves to be as much of a history lesson as an eye-opening thriller.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The articles, almost uniformly glowing about the NSA, serve as reminders that the men and women who surveil the world are not machines; they have good days and bad days, jokes and tears, and strange tales about their lives.

The prior jobs included being a craps dealer in Las Vegas, a developer of crossword puzzles for the \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em>, a professional baseball player in the Atlanta Braves farm system, a nanny for the daughter of Sunny von Bülow’s first husband, and a “mosquito bite test count subject” who was paid to visit forests and swamps to take off his shirt for a minute to assess the local mosquito population.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>even offers a window into the hopes and wide-eyed wonder of the agency’s youngest workers, its summer interns. The title of one intern’s article for \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>in 2004 was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830627-2004-08-13-SIDToday-How-I-Spent-My-Summer-Vacation.html\">How I Spent My Summer Vacation\u003c/a>,” while \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830624-2011-7-27-Culture-Shock-NSA-From-the-Perspective.html\">another article\u003c/a> in 2011 recounted that on their first day of work, a boisterous group of interns stepped into an elevator and got a quick and stern lecture from “an older gentleman” who warned that “the only thing you need to know is that we don’t talk in the elevators, and the extroverts look at \u003cem>other\u003c/em> people’s shoes.” The interns silently shared the same reaction — “\u003cem>What have we gotten ourselves into\u003c/em>\u003cem>?\u003c/em>”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why\">The Intercept Is Broadening Access to the Snowden Archive.

Bush administration began bringing prisoners to Guantánamo \u003ca href=\"http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/timeline\">in early 2002\u003c/a>, and by the end of the year, over 600 men had been processed at the prison.  Over the next few years, over a hundred more would arrive. Despite the Bush administration’s rhetoric that Guantánamo held “the worst of the worst,” many of them were innocent men, some of whom had been sold for bounty to U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Gen. H. Steven Blum, “planned to take the prisoners into U.S. custody as soon as they were released by the Bosnians. The prisoners would be taken from Sarajevo up to Tuzla.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The staffer was tasked with watching for the possibility of an ambush on the military convoy. The men’s release, she wrote, “was delayed for several hours due to a large demonstration outside the building they were being held in,” and “the convoy did not leave Sarajevo until after midnight.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The ‘gentlemen’ in question are still guests of the U.S. government, at Guantánamo Bay,” she wrote in the entry dated September 3, 2008. In fact, just a few months later, a federal judge \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97264590\">ordered\u003c/a> five of the six men released on lack of evidence.

As time has gone on, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> has sought out new ways to get documents from the archive into the hands of the public, consistent with the public interest as originally conceived.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Today, \u003ci>The Intercept \u003c/i>is announcing two innovations in how we report on and publish these materials. Both measures are designed to ensure that reporting on the archive continues in as expeditious and informative a manner as possible, in accordance with the agreements we entered into with our source about how these materials would be disclosed, a framework \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715323533824548864?lang=en\">that he\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/23/facts-nsa-stories-reported/\">and we\u003c/a>, have publicly described on numerous occasions.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The first measure involves the publication of large batches of documents. W\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">e are, beginning today, publishing in installments the NSA&#8217;s internal \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">newsletters, which span more than a decade beginning after 9/11. We are starting with the oldest \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles, from 2003, and working our way through the most recent in our archive, from 2012. Our first release today contains 166 documents, all from 2003, and we will periodically release batches until we have made public the entire set. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">The documents are available on a special section of \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">documents run a wide gamut: from serious, detailed reports on top secret NSA surveillance programs to breezy, trivial meanderings of analysts’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">trips and vacations, with much in between. Many are self-serving and boastful, designed to justify budgets or impress supervisors. Others contain obvious errors or mindless parroting of public source material. But some \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles have been the basis of significant revelations from the archive. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Accompanying the release of these documents are summaries of the content of each, along with a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">story about NSA’s role in Guantánamo interrogations\u003c/a>, a lengthy roundup of other \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">intriguing information gleaned from these files\u003c/a>, and a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies\">profile of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/a>. We encourage other journalists, researchers, and interested parties to comb through these documents, along with future published batches, to find additional material of interest. Others may well find stories, or clues that lead to stories, that we did not. (To contact us about such finds, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/about/#contact\">see the instructions here\u003c/a>.) A primary objective of these batch releases is to make that kind of exploration possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Consistent with the requirements of our agreement with our source, our editors and reporters have carefully examined each document, redacted names of low-level functionaries and other information that could impose serious harm on innocent individuals, and given the NSA an opportunity to comment on the documents to be published (the NSA&#8217;s comments resulted in no redactions other than two names of relatively low-level employees that we agreed, consistent with our long-standing policy, to redact). Further information about how we prepared the documents for publication is available \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">in a separate article\u003c/a>. We believe these releases will enhance public understanding of these extremely powerful and secretive surveillance agencies.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The other innovation is our ability to invite outside journalists, including from foreign media outlets, to work with us to explore the full Snowden archive.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">From the start of our reporting on the archive, a major component of our approach has been to partner with foreign (and other American) media outlets rather than try to keep all the material for ourselves. We\u003cem> \u003c/em>have collectively shared documents with more than two dozen media outlets, and teams of journalists in numerous countries have thus worked with and reported on Snowden documents (that&#8217;s independent of the other media outlets which have long possessed large portions of the Snowden archive — the\u003ci> Washington Post\u003c/i>, the\u003ci> New York Times\u003c/i>, \u003ci>The Guardian\u003c/i>, \u003cem>ProPublica\u003c/em>). This partnership approach has greatly expedited the reporting, and also ensured that stories that most affect specific countries are reported by the journalists who best understand those countries.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But allowing other journalists full access to the archive presented security and legal challenges that took time and resources to resolve. We now feel comfortable that we can do so consistent with the responsibility demanded by these materials and our agreement with our source. We have begun to provide archive access to journalists from \u003ci>Le Monde\u003c/i> and other media outlets in collaboration with \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s editorial, research, legal, and technology teams. \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We are excited by the reporting this new arrangement will generate. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">There are still many documents of legitimate interest to the public that can and should be disclosed. There are also documents in the archive that we do not believe should be published because of the severe harm they would cause innocent people (e.g., private communications intercepted by NSA, the disclosure of which would destroy privacy rights; and documents containing government speculation about bad acts committed by private individuals (typically from marginalized communities), the disclosure of which would permanently destroy reputations). \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">An archive of this significance and size obviously presents complicated questions about how best to report on it. There is rarely one easy, obvious answer how to do it. Different leaks may require different approaches. I’ve always believed that WikiLeaks’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">reporting on and disclosure of the materials provided by Chelsea Manning and other sources have been superb. But that does not mean that it is the only viable framework, or the optimal tactical approach, for all leaks. Moreover, different whistleblowers have their own conditions and demands for how the material can be disclosed, which any ethical journalist must obviously honor in full.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We have navigated these difficult and sometimes conflicting values in deciding how best to report on this massive archive. These two new approaches will, we believe, facilitate reporting and disclosure while fulfilling our obligations to the public and to our source. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">How We Prepared the NSA’s Sensitive Internal Reports for Release\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">NSA Closely Involved in Guantánamo Interrogations, Documents Show\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">The Most Intriguing Spy Stories From 166 Internal NSA Reports\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies/\">The NSA’s Newspaper Reveals the Human Side of America’s Digital Spies\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why/","thumbnail":{"ID":65368,"title":"","excerpt":"","content":"","credit":"","sizes":{"feature_hero":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-feature-hero.jpg","width":1200,"height":800},"promo":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-promo.jpg","width":440,"height":220},"promo_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-promo-large.jpg","width":900,"height":450},"top_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-top-large.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"top_small":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-top-small.jpg","width":200,"height":200},"square":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-440x440.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"article_header":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4-article-header.jpg","width":1440,"height":720},"original":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/pgp-key4.jpg","width":"1440","height":"720"}}},"date":"2016-05-16T15:37:52+00:00","authors":[{"ID":7,"display_name":"Glenn Greenwald","url":"https://theintercept.com/staff/glenn-greenwald/","brief_bio":"Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, constitutional lawyer, and author of four \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em> best-selling books on politics and law.","full_bio":"\u003cp>Glenn Greenwald is one of three co-founding editors of The Intercept.

But U.S. aid continued.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Congress has passed several laws restricting military aid to countries that systematically violate human rights.

Between 2010 and 2015, the State Department has issued 1,280 weapons export licenses to Egypt, but it has only conducted four post-shipment checks in the past five years. In one check on riot control gear – including rubber bullet cartridges and smoke grenades – the Egyptian Interior Ministry simply did not respond to the State Department’s repeated requests for information. But the State Department nonetheless closed the request as “favorable.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The GAO also reports that the U.S. “did not complete all required vetting” for recipients of U.S. training, “prior to providing training.” Between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. embassy vetted more than 5,500 individuals or units in the Egyptian security forces and rejected only 18 – far less than 1 percent. The State Department did not reject a single case after the military coup in 2013.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The State Department’s internal regulations require embassies to upload information on “gross human rights violations” into a computer system, so that future employees can conduct vetting. But the GAO found that since 2011, only three reports of human rights violations had been uploaded, and none since the military coup in 2013.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under current law, 15 percent of U.S. aid to Egypt can be withheld if it doesn’t meet certain human rights conditions. There is an exemption, however, based on the U.S.&#8217;s &#8220;national security interest,&#8221; which was invoked last year to send the full amount.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite that fact, as my colleague Zaid Jilani \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/02/10/obama-proposes-removing-human-rights-conditions-on-aid-to-egypt/\">reported\u003c/a>, President Obama has proposed \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/02/10/obama-proposes-removing-human-rights-conditions-on-aid-to-egypt/\">stripping out\u003c/a> human rights restrictions on aid sent to Egypt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top Photo: Egyptian army vehicles block the access to Tahrir Square in December 2013, as Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters demonstrate nearby.\u003c/p>\n","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/12/state-department-fails-to-vet-or-monitor-military-aid-to-egypt/","thumbnail":{"ID":64903,"title":"EGYPT-POLITICS-DEMO-UNREST","excerpt":"Egyptian army vehicles block the access to Tahrir square as Egyptian Muslim brotherhood supporters demonstrate in the nearby on Talaat Harb Square on December 1, 2013 in Cairo.

In March, Israel&#8217;s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, threatened to revoke Barghouti&#8217;s residency rights, explicitly admitting that this was in retaliation for his speech and advocacy: &#8220;He is using his resident status to travel all over the world in order to operate against Israel in the most serious manner. &#8230; He took advantage of our enlightened state to portray us as the most horrible state in the world.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch \u003ca href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israel-imposes-travel-ban-bds-co-founder-omar-barghouti\">told the\u003cem> Electronic Intifada\u003c/em>\u003c/a> that &#8220;Israel’s refusal to renew Barghouti’s travel document appears to be an effort to punish him for exercising his right to engage in peaceful, political activism, using its arsenal of bureaucratic control over Palestinian lives.&#8221; She added: &#8220;Israel has used this sort of control to arbitrarily ban many Palestinians from traveling, as well as to ban international human rights monitors, journalists, and activists from entering Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the threats to Barghouti from the Israeli government extend far beyond his right to travel. Last month, Amnesty International \u003ca href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/israeli-government-must-cease-intimidation-of-human-rights-defenders-protect-them-from-attacks\">issued an extraordinary warning\u003c/a> that the group &#8220;is concerned for the safety and liberty&#8221; of Barghouti, citing threats from Israel&#8217;s minister of transport, intelligence, and atomic energy, Yisrael Katz, who called on Israel to engage in &#8220;targeted civil eliminations&#8221; of BDS leaders with the help of Israeli intelligence. As Amnesty noted, &#8220;The term alludes to &#8216;targeted assassinations&#8217; which is used to describe Israel’s policy of targeting members of Palestinian armed groups.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> has \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/05/11/canadian-covernment-exploiting-charlie-hebdo-attack-threatens-prosecute-advocates-israel-boycott/\">regularly reported\u003c/a> over the last year, the attempts to \u003cem>criminalize\u003c/em> BDS activism &#8212; not only in Israel but internationally &#8212; are one of the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/02/16/greatest-threat-to-free-speech-in-the-west-criminalizing-activism-against-israeli-occupation/\">greatest threats to free speech\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/10/27/criminalization-of-anti-israel-activism-escalates-this-time-in-the-land-of-the-charlie-hebdo-free-speech-march/\">assembly rights in the West\u003c/a>.

And my guest today is Omar Barghouti, who is a Palestinian human rights activist and one of the co-founders of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, better known as BDS, which is designed to put non-violent international pressure on Israel to end the occupation of Palestinian territories, establish equal rights for Palestinians, and accept the right to return of Palestinian refugees who fled during and after the establishment of Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">BDS has gained considerable international support over the last few years as the West has watched Israel expand its occupation of the West Bank, while its army kills thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. And as a result of that success, BDS has come under a multi-pronged attack from Israel and its supporters around the world.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">As part of that attack, this week news broke that Israel denied Barghouti an international travel permit. As a resident of Israel he is required to apply for this permit every two years to travel internationally. Human Rights Watch condemned the act “as something that appears to be an effort to punish him for exercising his right to engage in peaceful political activism.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Before welcoming you I just want to say that I’ve spoken to a lot of people over the last several years who are probably subject to electronic surveillance on their telephones, but I’m not sure I’ve ever spoken to someone who’s subject to as much surveillance as you are.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan id=\"fa1\">\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So with that, thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me, I really appreciate it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Before I ask you to just talk a little bit about what happened with this travel restriction, I just want to give a little bit context and background for listeners. This didn’t really come out of nowhere; in late March, Israel’s interior minister was quoted as telling a conference that he was considering revoking your residency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">He said: “I was given information that his life is in Ramallah and he is using his resident status to travel all over the world in order to operate against Israel in the most serious manner.” He continued: “He was given rights similar to those of a citizen and he took advantage of our enlightened state to portray us as the most horrible state in the world.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Amnesty has said that they’re actually “concerned for your safety and liberty” and they cited a quote from the Israeli minister of transport and intelligence and atomic energy, Yisrael Katz, who called on Israel to engage in “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS leaders with the help of Israeli intelligence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So, with that context in mind, obviously the Israeli government has become obsessed with restricting and punishing BDS leaders. Tell us about this new travel restriction that Israel has imposed on you. How did you learn about it? What is it?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>OMAR BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Every couple of years I have to renew my Israeli travel document and without that I cannot leave or re-enter the country. Because I’m a permanent resident in Israel, I cannot leave on any other passport except the Israeli travel document.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Do you have another passport?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Yes, I have Jordanian citizenship.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: But in order to leave Israel, you need their permission every two years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Yes. On April 19 the Ministry of Interior in Acre where I live officially informed us that they will not renew my travel document, therefore effectively banning me from travel. This comes as you rightly noted in the context of very heightened repression against the BDS movement, which seeks freedom, justice, and equality for Palestinian citizens. So it seeks Palestinian rights under international law. But because it has become so effective of late, because support has been rising tremendously in the last couple of years, we are in a way paying the price for the success of the movement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Many people are realizing that Israel is a regime of occupation, settler colonialism, and apartheid and are therefore taking action to hold it to account to international law. Israel is realizing that companies are abandoning their projects in Israel that violate international law, pension funds are doing the same, major artists are refusing to play Tel Aviv, as Sun City was boycotted during apartheid South Africa.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So they’re seeing this isolation growing, they can see the South Africa moment, if you will. And because of that, they’ve heightened their repression, including espionage on BDS human rights defenders, whether Palestinian, Israeli, or international, surveillance, of course, plus those latest threats of targeted civil elimination and banning us from travel and so on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So we are really unnerved, I am personally quite unnerved by those threats. We take them very seriously, especially in this context. We live in a country where racism and racial incitement against indigenous Palestinians has grown tremendously into the Israeli mainstream. It has really become mainstream today to be very openly racist against Palestinians. Many settlers and hard-right-wing Israelis are taking matters into their own hands – completely supported by the state – and attacking Palestinians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So in that context I am unnerved, but I’m certainly undeterred. I shall continue my non-violent struggle for Palestinian rights under international law and nothing they can do will stop me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: About the travel restrictions themselves, how long have you been receiving this travel permission? Did they give you any reason as to why in this case it was being denied? And did you have any problems in the past – from their perspective – that would justify this denial?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: No, actually I’ve been a permanent resident of Israel since 1994, so 22 years running and without any violations of the law – not even a traffic violation. So there’s nothing on my record that they can use against me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Calling for a boycott until now is not a crime in Israel. It’s a tort – they can punish me in various ways – but it’s not a crime that they can revoke my residency right based upon. And they know that very well – they don’t stand on very strong legal grounds. So they’re looking for ways to intimidate me, to bully me, to silence me by other ways. And that doesn’t seem to be working, so now they’re working on revoking my permanent residency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">I have not had any problems in the past having my travel document renewed, for 22 years. So it’s just when BDS started to really become a very impactful, very effective movement with impressive growth and support, including among young Jewish Americans, young Jewish Brits, and so on – and that really alarms Israel – only then that they start taking such repressive, anti-democratic, draconian measures to the extreme against the movement, which is a non-violent movement, accusing us of all sorts of things.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: So as far as your status in Israel is concerned, and your right to travel, if I’m not mistaken you live in Israel with your wife who is an Israeli citizen, correct?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Yes, correct, my wife is a Palestinian citizen of Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: So does that give you entitlement to stay or are they actually able to revoke your permanent residency status?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: When it comes to non-Jews – as we’re called in Israel – no one knows what applies and what doesn’t apply. As you know there are more than 50 laws in Israel that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of the state, let alone Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who are non-citizens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So, a Palestinian citizen of Israel does not get the full set of rights that a Jewish citizen gets because simply the Palestinian is not a Jewish national and only if you’re a Jewish national – whatever that means – do you get the full set of rights. This is an extra-territorial definition of nationality so Israel does not have Israeli nationality – there is no such thing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">The Supreme Court rejected that notion, the Knesset did, there is no Israeli nationality. There is Israeli citizenship but that does not entitle you to the full set of rights. So yes, my wife is an Israeli citizen and I got my permanent residency through that but what rights I’m entitled to and am not entitled to depends on the mood of the politicians and how much the courts are ready to go along with that.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Let’s discuss the efforts against the BDS movement more broadly beyond Israeli borders. For a long time I think the tactic was to try and ignore BDS, to treat it as though it was so marginalized and inconsequential that it wasn’t even worth discussing or acknowledging let along taking action against. And, as you’ve suggested, as it’s become a much more widely accepted tactic, as the world watched in horror – I think one of the turning points of the last operation in Gaza that killed so many children and innocent men and women – it has become a tactic that in a lot of ways is starting to replicate, as you suggested as well, what happened in South Africa across lots of college campuses. Young American Jews who are fully now on board with BDS as a moral and necessary tactic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">And as a result you’ve starting to see more world leaders and people like Hillary Clinton denounce BDS in the most vehement terms, even equating it with anti-Semitism and I think most disturbing of all, actual laws are now being issued, not just in the United States but throughout Europe, to criminalize BDS and make it illegal to advocate it or engage in activism on its behalf.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Talk about what you’ve witnessed as someone who’s been in this movement from the beginning, about the changes that are underway in terms of how the response is developing\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>toward this movement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: I think after years of failure in stopping or even slowing down the growth of BDS and the growth of support for BDS around the world, especially in the West, Israel is resorting to its most powerful weapon, if you will, which is using its influence in the U.S. Congress and through that its influence in Brussels and in the E.U. and so on to criminalize BDS from above, after failing to stop it from below.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Because BDS is growing at the grassroots level – trade unions, academic unions, student groups, LGBTQ groups, women groups and so on, Israel is resorting to that attempt to delegitimize it from above.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So as you rightly said, they’re working on passing legislation across the United States and state legislatures to criminalize BDS or to “blacklist” individuals and organizations involved in BDS, reminding us of the worst days of McCarthyism. So really, Israel is fostering a new McCarthyism, and nothing less than that because it’s calling on governments that it deems friendly to punish speech, punish activism and campaigning to uphold Palestinian rights under international law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So this is a non-violent inclusive movement that is anchored in the international declaration of human rights. It’s opposed to all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism. And we’re not shy about that. We’re very categorical about our opposition to all forms of racism. Because of that – not despite that – Israel is extremely worried. Israel’s regime of occupation and apartheid is worried when this human rights inclusive movement is reaching out and appealing to a mass public, including many young Jewish Americans.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So it’s resorting to this new McCarthyism. In France, it’s the worst, with government actually saying that calling for a boycott of Israeli products is now illegal in France. You can call for a boycott of French products in Paris and that’s okay, but not of Israeli products. Imagine the enormous hypocrisy.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: And people have been arrested wearing pro-BDS T-shirts in Paris.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Exactly. The measure of repression in France is unprecedented. We have not seen anything like that. Paris has really become the capital of anti-Palestinian repression of late. Imagine – the city of freedoms, supposedly, has become the city of darkness for Palestinians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: There was a huge free speech march there just over a year ago.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: We don’t see this anti-Palestinian repression as isolated. Israel is fostering this, but there is a lot of repression already in the West. There’s already an attack on unions, an attack on free speech, on social justice, racial justice movements, there’s enormous militarization and securitization of society in the West.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">And Israel is benefiting from this enormous homeland security and military market – it’s great business for Israel. It’s training police forces across the United States, from Ferguson to Baltimore. London police, Paris police.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: One of the criticisms of BDS opponents, when they hear things like what you just said, denouncing this erosion of civil liberties throughout the West, including in Europe, is they say it’s kind of ironic, maybe even hypocritical of you, as an advocate and proponent of Palestinian rights, to be critiquing civil liberties erosions in the West when throughout the Palestinian territories there certainly are no rights for LGBTs, or very few, and that there are far fewer rights for women for civil liberties in places like Gaza and certain parts of the West Bank. How do you respond to that? Is that something you address in your activism for Palestinian rights?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Sure. As an inclusive movement, we call for equal rights for all humans, irrespective of identity. So absolutely, we oppose every form of discrimination against anyone based on any identity attribute. Now, do we have repression in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza? Absolutely.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are under Israeli military occupation so they’re suffering\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>denial of all rights, from freedom of movement to the right of free speech, to all kinds of rights, to the right to life in some cases, as we’ve seen in Gaza. But yes, on top of that, there is social repression, of course.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Imposed by Palestinians on other Palestinians.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Imposed by the Palestinian authority, by the authorities in Gaza and that’s yes, Palestinian repression on Palestinians. But the authority in Ramallah is buttressed, is supported entirely by Western governments, by the United States, by European governments and to a large extent, by Israel.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So it’s not like the European and American funders are pushing for more democratization and free speech and civil liberties. They’re accepting the growing repression of the Palestinian authorities so long as it does the job, carrying some of the burdens of the occupation while Israel continues to colonize and ethnically cleanse and commit war crimes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: You talked a little earlier about what you say now is this open racism and even supporters of Israel, people who openly self-identify as Zionist, have sounded these alarm bells about the deterioration of civic discourse on Israel, about how things that were once unthinkable or relegated to a fringe have now become mainstream.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">You’re somebody who has lived in Israel since 1994, so 22 years now – how do you describe the changes in terms of what has taken place in Israel domestically? Is it something you regard as a radical departure from what has taken place or is it a natural evolution of something that was a little bit more hidden, that people were maybe a bit more polite about 20 years ago, but is now just made a bit more explicit?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: I think racism is inherent in any colonial society and Israel is no exception. As a regime of settler colonialism, occupation, and apartheid, racism is not coincidental. It’s a pillar of the system. Look at how Israel treats BDS. BDS calls for boycott, divestment, and sanctions to achieve Palestinian freedom, justice, and equality and they see that as a major threat. But freedom, justice, and equality only threaten lack of freedom, injustice, and inequality. It doesn’t threaten anyone else who isn’t premised on the existence of racism.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Certainly, as you rightly said, Israel has dropped the mask. With the last elections in 2015, Israel elected its most racist government ever and we have the most racist parliament ever. The most racist Knesset ever, as \u003cem>Haaretz\u003c/em>, the Israeli newspaper, calls it. To the extent that a couple of days ago, the deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army said that racism is growing to an extent that reminds people of 1930s Germany.\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>This is the deputy chief of staff in Israel – this is not some nobody on the streets of London or Paris. This is an extremely important statement by one of the top generals in Israel. He is very alarmed that those symptoms of extreme racism are appearing everywhere and are becoming prevalent in Israeli society. And that is really, really scary.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">On the other hand, by dropping the mask, Israel’s regime has in a way accelerated the growth of movements like ours.\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>Boycott has grown tremendously – I’ve said this before and I’ll repeat it – we can attribute part of the success, part of the credit, for the growth and impact of BDS to the Israeli government’s far-right policies and their dropping the mask of enlightenment democracy and so on. They’re doing away with that, with the Ministry of Education instilling extreme racist notions in textbooks, with the Minister of Culture requiring Loyalty Oaths by artists who want to perform in Tel Aviv.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">It’s really reaching an unprecedented level of bare racism. Racism was always there but it was always very couched, very hidden by a supposedly liberal Zionist façade that projects to the world Israeli scientific miracles and cultural miracles and whitewashing very well Israel’s deeply rooted racist colonial society.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: My final question is about a couple of reservations or criticisms or objections toward the BDS platform that come not from the obvious opponents of BDS but from people who are generally very sympathetic to the Palestinian cause who even are very harsh critics of Israel. A lot of the time people in that camp will say the following: “Why is it that Israel specifically should be boycotted for its human rights violations when so many other countries in the world including the United States are guilty of at least equal if not greater human rights violations and yet there’s no boycott movement for them?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">And then the other related criticism is that the platform of BDS itself &#8212; by including a right of return to Palestinians, which would, if accepted, essentially result in the end of Israel as a Jewish state and is something that Israel will never ever accept &#8212; makes the BDS movement something designed to achieve a goal that can never actually be achieved and therefore, less effective.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">How do you respond to those two concerns or criticisms?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: It’s funny when people on the fringe talk about effectiveness,\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>when Israel is fighting BDS with such immense resources\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> \u003c/span>around the world, inducing governments to pass laws to fight it, using its intelligence sources to spy on citizens around the world – human rights activists involved in BDS. It’s very strange to hear anything about the effectiveness of the movement. I think that’s settled by now. Companies are abandoning Israeli projects, pension funds are abandoning Israeli projects, major churches, major academic associations across the world, especially in the U.S., are taking action.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: But when they do that, they’re doing that – at least in terms of what they’re expressing – in opposition to the occupation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Not just that. When you look at academic associations and trade unions, Glenn, they’ve gone way beyond that. Churches, yes, they’ve stuck to the occupation only, but when you look at academic associations – the American Studies Association, the Anthropological Association, Women’s Studies and so on, they’ve gone for a full academic boycott of Israel, which targets all Israeli academic institutions because of their complicity in planning, implementing, and whitewashing Israel’s regime of oppression.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: What I meant was not that their boycott is directed only at Israelis in the occupied territories but rather that their objective in supporting the boycott is not to secure right of return for the Palestinians, as they describe it, but instead is to end the occupation. Would you agree with that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: In fact, most partners and supporters of BDS completely support the three planks in our BDS call of 2005, which is ending the occupation, ending the racial discrimination in Israel and the system of apartheid and right of return. So we’re not aware of partners who do not support the right of return as a basic U.N. stipulated right.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">All refugees, be they Jewish refugees from World War II to refugees from Kosovo, have that right. This is in international law and Palestinians should not be excluded. It’s quite racist to say that the return of Palestinian refugees would end Israeli apartheid and that’s bad because? What is so wrong about refugees having the right to return home? If that disturbs an apartheid system that’s premised on being exclusionary and racist and that does not want to see people gain their rights, what’s the argument there?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Just to be clear, the argument that I’m describing here &#8212; and by the way, this isn’t my argument, I’m not advocating it, I’m simply articulating it &#8212; it’s the objection that comes not from right-wing critics of BDS but from a lot of allies and a lot of people who are long-time supporters of Palestinian rights, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">The argument is not that the right of return is not justifiable, morally or ethically, in fact I think both of them &#8212; and pretty much everyone would agree with them &#8212; would say that in an ideal world Palestinians would have the right to return. Their argument is a tactical or pragmatic one: that if you allow Palestinians the right of return it would essentially mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state, which in turn means that Israel will never ever agree to it. And so you’ve essentially created an unattainable goal, one that can never happen and isn’t realistic and is therefore designed not to help Palestinians, but to be this objective that is inevitably destined to fail.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Well actually that’s a very dogmatic objection. Saying that it will never happen ignores history, ignores that major empires have collapsed in our lifetime that were thought to be invincible just years before collapsing. Who would have thought a country as powerful as the Soviet Union would collapse? Who would have thought in the 1980s that apartheid in South Africa would collapse? Who would have thought that East Timor would have autonomy when 20 years before, no one knew where East Timor was?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">So it’s really quite dogmatic for people to say only when it comes to protecting Israeli apartheid you cannot question it – if you dare, Israel will bring down the house on everyone.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Israel depends tremendously on public support from the outside, from complicity from Western governments. As that erodes, as BDS grows and public support for BDS grows, and Israel gets isolated in the academic, economic, cultural, and military sphere, eventually, it will have to abide by international law, and we will see dissent growing in Israel like any other colonial state.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">We will not see dissent as long as the price is not high enough. When it becomes high enough we will see growing dissent and more Jewish Israelis joining the ranks of BDS so that we can both ethically shape a future together based on justice, freedom, and equality.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Going back to the first point, which was why target Israel and not the United States. Archbishop Desmond Tutu had a very similar argument with this issue when it was brought up about South Africa. He said certainly apartheid Africa was not by far the most evil system of oppression around, but you could not ask South Africans – the black majority – why are you fighting apartheid? If you’re sick with the flu you don’t fight another illness, you fight the sickness that you are suffering from.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">The Palestinians are under an Israeli regime of oppression so naturally we have to fight this immediate oppressor. Now the fact that Israel is completely supported by the United States &#8212; sponsored, bank-rolled, protected &#8212; that doesn’t mean that we should not fight our immediate oppressor. That’s how you effectively make a change and achieve your rights.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">This is not an intellectual exercise. Yes, one can call for a boycott of all governments that support Israel’s oppression – the United States and so on – but that’s intellectualism that leads to no action. If we follow Paulo Freire’s reflection and action model, that you have to reflect and then act, you’re not acting by calling for a boycott of the United States because it’s the only surviving empire. It’s invincible at this point in time, in 2016. It would be completely ridiculous to call for a boycott of the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">As Naomi Klein said, it would never work. Boycotts are not just intellectual exercises, they have to work. We’re not in it for fun, we’re not in it to make a point. We‘re in it to gain our freedom and rights under international law and for that we have to be very strategic.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: I said that would be my last question, but I actually have one more – a very narrow, specific question about the news of the denial of your travel permit. Are there appeals available to you? Do you have legal recourse that you can seek in order to get the decision reversed and do you intend to do that?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: I cannot speak a lot about our legal strategy, but certainly we’re exposing this around the world. We rely on action by citizens of the world, not on the governments because governments are very complicit in Israel’s regime of oppression, but Jewish Voice for Peace, U.S. Campaign to End Israeli Occupation, and other groups have started campaigning in the U.S. against this travel ban against me. And many, many groups are working for the right to BDS. Even if you disagree with some of the tactics of BDS, on purely free speech grounds you’ve got to support our right to call for BDS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">In the United States in particular, it&#8217;s protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution so even the\u003ci> New York Times\u003c/i> at one point defended our right to advocate for BDS while being completely against BDS.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">I think Israel will face a problem that it is alienating the liberal mainstream and that will be really the final stroke in its wall-to-wall support in the United States.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>GREENWALD\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Well, there are loads of people who love to wrap themselves in the flag of free speech rights, including supporters of Israel, and hopefully those people will have the courage of their convictions that even if they don’t agree with your positions on BDS and Israel generally in the occupation, that they would nonetheless see it as highly objectionable that you should be denied the most basic right of international travel simply because the Israeli government wants to punish you for your political views or constrain you from engaging in activism internationally. And hopefully this interview will help to bring some attention to what has been done to you.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cb>BARGHOUTI\u003c/b>\u003c/span>: Thank you so much, Glenn.\u003c/p>\n","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/13/interview-with-bds-advocate-omar-barghouti-banned-by-israel-from-traveling-threatened-with-worse/","thumbnail":{"ID":64974,"title":"Omar Barghouti","excerpt":"","content":"","credit":"Photo: Nasser Nasser/AP","sizes":{"feature_hero":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-feature-hero.jpg","width":1200,"height":800},"promo":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-promo.jpg","width":440,"height":220},"promo_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-promo-large.jpg","width":900,"height":450},"top_large":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-top-large.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"top_small":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-top-small.jpg","width":200,"height":200},"square":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-440x440.jpg","width":440,"height":440},"article_header":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182-article-header.jpg","width":1440,"height":720},"original":{"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2016/05/AP_16131491139182.jpg","width":"4837","height":"3409"}}},"date":"2016-05-13T10:50:47+00:00","authors":[{"ID":7,"display_name":"Glenn Greenwald","url":"https://theintercept.com/staff/glenn-greenwald/","brief_bio":"Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, constitutional lawyer, and author of four \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em> best-selling books on politics and law.","full_bio":"\u003cp>Glenn Greenwald is one of three co-founding editors of The Intercept.
