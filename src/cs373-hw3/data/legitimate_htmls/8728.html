<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">Recently, a Singaporean insurance agent was sentenced to a 14 day detention order for an assault on a taxi driver. The assault took place when a 23 year old punched a driver, after drinking in Clarke Quay with friends. He had argued with the driver over the $18 fare in the run up to the incident.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><a target='_blank' href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/conner395/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="357" alt="" style="float:left" class="blogimg" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/law_and_order_in_singapore.jpg" /></a>Though his eventual punishment was far smaller than the potential five years in prison that Lai could have served, it is interesting to note that the story was quite big news in Singapore. In this bustling, multicultural melting pot of a state, with a population of over 5 million people crammed onto a 716 km&sup2; island, incidents are extremely rare. In a similarly densely packed, business-heavy urban area, like, say, Paris, New York or London, such a story would barely be a story or, at least, certainly not a story that would grab many headlines.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The reason for this is that Singapore is one of the most peaceful, safe and non-violent states in the world. This fact, as much as the low tax rates, superb education, gorgeous weather and pro-business legal system, contributes massively to why so many people are now coming here to work, study and live.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">So how do the Singaporean authorities manage to keep the peace so effectively?</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Singaporean law and order</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Singapore's laws are there to ensure that the population are free to roam the streets in peace and quiet, without needing to worry about the lewd or violent behaviour. In some cases, these laws become very strict indeed, though it is this strictness, and the respect for authority that they inspire, that ensures the state remains a law-abiding one.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">For example, littering, chewing gum and smoking can all get you in big trouble in Singapore. Expect a fine of up to $1,000 the first time you are caught dropping your rubbish on the street and $2,000 the second time, plus a spot of Corrective Work Order. Corrective Work Order, or CWO, forces you to donate a few hours of your spare time cleaning up a public place wearing an unmissably bright orange jacket watched and recorded by the local media.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">As most people know, chewing gum is strictly contraband in Singapore, as a preventative measure against the littering that the authorities so despise. Possessing, selling or gifting chewing gum will all land you in trouble. Though this might sound draconian, the ban was brought in as chewing gum stuck on the Mass Rapid Transit train doors was actually preventing trains from being able to run, causing a serious safety hazard.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">One of the major no-nos of Singapore is drugs. Possessing any of the following quantities of following controlled substances will land you the death penalty: 15 grammes heroin, 30 grammes morphine, 30 grammes cocaine, 500 grammes cannabis and 1.2 kg of opium. Again, if this sounds strict, it is worth remembering Singapore's geographical position. Just an hour away from the notorious Golden Triangle, Asia's chief opium producing area located on the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam, the authorities must do all they can to ensure that the drug trade, and the violence and corruption that come with it, do not invade their shores.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph10">All of these laws contribute greatly to ensuring Singapore remains the healthy, thriving, happy society it is today and help keep incidents like the one we mentioned earlier thankfully rare occurrences.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">As the Singaporean economy grows and grows, more and more foreign money pours into Singapore. Thanks to the state's low corporate tax rates, tremendously free market and highly advantageous business laws, firms and organisations from around the world are lining up to pump their cash through Singapore.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bnarin/"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="189" alt="" style="float:left" class="blogimg" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/sg-europe.jpg" /></a>Though the state is benefiting greatly from this investment and interest, it is only understandable that Singaporean companies would become interesting in sending investment the other way &ndash; i.e. investing money in western countries, particularly those in the EU. Yet, due to the stricter and more regimented economies there, this is not always straight forward.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">In order to make things simpler for both sides, a potential Free Trade Agreement between the more powerful EU economies and Singapore has long been mooted. After all, a mutually beneficial FTA would allow both consumers and businesses on all sides to make the most from Singapore's strengthening economic power. However, though Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have both backed such a move, it now seems unlikely it will come into place until at least late 2016.  The main issue, according to Mr Lee, is that countries in the EU require more time to get their own economic issues in order before opening up the gates for such trading. Currently we understand that Singapore has an extensive network of 20 implemented FTAs with 31 trading partners. </div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">After meeting with Ms Merkel, Lee said, &ldquo;The ratification process is on the European side. The text is still undergoing some legal scrubbing. Some parts are completed, some parts are not. Then you have to go through a long process, including voting at the European Parliament and including ratification by majority of the European member states.&rdquo;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">One of the central issues holding the potential FTA back is such an agreement's need for a provision for investor-state dispute settlement. This provision would allow a company to take action against a country's government outside of its borders and, though very helpful for companies in Singapore investing in the EU, it has been less popular with those on the other side.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Chancellor Merkel, however, is very much keen on pushing through the FTA as quickly as she can. Given Germany's status as one of the world's most active and consistent exporters of products, it is clear why Merkel wants to open up as many potential trade routes as possible for her economy. Mr. Lee highlighted the similarities between Germany and Singapore at the press conference, with the states sharing many of the same advantages and disadvantages. As well as both housing booming economies and powerful workforces, both nations may soon have to deal with issues brought about by ageing population and lowering birth rates. Many of the same political issues are on both state's radar too, such as multicultural integration and the threat of radical political ideologies.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph7">In particular, Mr. Lee cited the Islamic State group as a menace to both Germany and Singapore, pointing out that both German and Singaporean Muslims have left their native countries to join the brutal jihadist outfit. Therefore, anything that strengthens the existing bonds between the two states, and makes communication between them more straightforward, should be welcomed.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Lee Hsien Loong is the Prime Minister of Singapore. Here he discusses how important it is for Singaporeans not to look down on those who have less, materially, even though the economy is booming and business is good.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">With a varied cultural mixture of entertainment, cuisine and shopping, Singapore stands out as one of the most travel-friendly Asian countries. Whether you travel in August or January, the city-island has warm weather all year round. Besides, tourists also love Singapore because it is easy to get around the island, as it has an extensive and easy-to-use public transport system.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="509" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/tourisim-guide-asia.jpg" class="blogimg" style="float:left" alt="" />Another reason why Singapore is so attractive for tourists is that one of the spoken languages is English, but they also speak Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Malay and Tamil. Therefore, the language barrier in Singapore is almost anecdotic.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">If you are travelling there, it might be useful to know that in terms of electricity, in Singapore they 230 Volts and 50 Hertz. Also, the phone code is +65.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Also, the official currency of the country is Singapore dollar. In comparison with American currency, US$1 equals SGD1.25. You can find many money exchanges throughout the city, particularly in the CBD and other tourist hotspots. You can always exchange money at major hotels and local banks, although the exchange rate will not be favourable for you. You can also withdraw money from the ATM machines scattered throughout the state.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Make sure you carry cash if you are thinking of making small purchases or buying goods from the markets and street vendors. However, you only need your credit card in major shopping centres.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">Although Singapore is highly tolerant of Western behaviour, there are certain local customs and laws that differ from those in the West. For instance, it might strike you that chewing gum is strictly prohibited for sale, import and personal use. But what might surprise you even more is that spitting is against the law. Besides, littering is not tolerated and offenders can get a tough fine for doing it.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">From luxury hotels like the Raffles Hotel to the five-star Shangri-La Hotel Singapore to budget accommodations like the Fragance Hotels and Value Hotels, there is a large array of accommodations to choose from in Singapore.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">As Singapore experiences a tropical climate that is hot and humid all year round, make sure you carry sunblock and drink enough water, especially from March to June when the weather is particularly hot.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">As to transportation, whether visitors choose to travel by standard trains or by light rail services, they can get anywhere on the island within a short timeframe. Also, buses connect most destinations on the island and a plethora of metered taxis can be found at any time.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Located approximately 20 minutes' drive from the CBD of Singapore, Changi International Airport (SIN) is well connected with the city by rail service as well as by express bus shuttles and metered taxis.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">Some of the most important events that take place in Singapore include the World Gourmet Summig (three-week fine food festival), Singapore International Film Festival (featuring a mix of up to 300 international documentaries, animation, shots and retrospectives), Singapore Airlines International Cup, Vesak Day (devotees flock to Buddhist temples where they make offerings, eat vegetarian food and even release captive animals), Singapore Arts Festival, Singapore Dragon Boat Festival, and the Festival of the Hungry Ghosts with celebration dinners, loud auctions and outdoor street performances of Chinese opera, puppetry, singing and comedy.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Customers are now able to book premium economy tickets from <a target='_blank' href="http://www.singaporeair.com/" target="_blank">Singapore Airlines</a> for the first time. The new class of ticket will first be available on August 9th flights to Sydney, which went on sale recently. Though prices will vary depending on flight times and travel dates, generally a premium economy ticket will cost you about 15% - 20% more than its economy equivalent.</div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="214" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/sia-flights-travel-airtravel.jpg" class="blogimg" style="float:left" alt="" />So, what will that extra 15% get you? Well, there's more legroom for start, wider seats and generally superior amenities and facilities. Also, you will have a longer menu to choose your refreshments from, with more meal options.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">A premium economy seat on an SIA airplane will pack a calf rest and a footbar, with a width between 18.5 inches and 19.5 inches, while the chair itself will recline a full eight inches. This means a more comfortable seating arrangement a more flexibility in terms of how each individual customer decides to spend their flight. Champagne is available for those looking to travel in style, as are an extensive list of wines.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Flight entertainment is similarly more varied and more luxurious. You can expect a 13.3 inch full high definition in-flight monitor, equipped with headphones that prevent outside noise seeping in to break your concentration, and two USB ports powered by your very own in-seat power supply. A Premium Economy Class Ticket also entitles you to greater storage space, including dedicated spaces for your phone, water, laptop and tablet.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Yet SIA's commitment to giving Premium Economy customers a higher class of trip extends beyond the flight itself. In fact, from the moment you arrive at your departure airport to the moment you leave your destination airport, the entire experience is maximise for simplicity, convenience and comfort.</div>

<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Existing members of SIA's KrisFlyer scheme, who can already take advantage of special promotions and air miles from the company and its partners, have even more reasons to go Premium Economy. They receive 10% extra in miles every time they buy this type of ticket.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">SIA plans to roll out the availability of Premium Economy tickets soon, with flights to Beijing, New Delhi, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, London, Mumbai, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Zurich all slated to be equipped for this class of customer by next year.</div>
<div id="paragraph9" class="paragraph2">According to SIA Chief Executive Office Goh Choon Phong, the new class was created to match the demands of the airline's huge customer base. He says, &ldquo;Many of our customers' suggestions have been incorporated into the new product, and we are confident it will be well received by travellers who are looking for more features - in the seat design, in-flight offerings and exclusive privileges - all underpinned by the exceptional service that SIA is well known for, both on the ground and in the air."</div>

<div class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Any list of people claiming to be this or that is bound to be fairly subjective. This is particularly the case when considering those people who have been most influential on the development of Singapore. After all, this tally is potentially very long and open to a great deal of personal bias. However, it is safe to say there are certain names that would be fairly universal.<a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pacificairforces/"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="right" hspace="5" height="253" class="blogimg" style="float:right" alt="" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/singapore_most_influential_people.jpg" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">One name that should feature is Dr Kanwaljit Soin, who became a much-needed female member of parliament when she was nominated in 1992. After holding her political position for four years, she has since continued to work tirelessly to raise awareness of female issues. While serving as president of the Association of Women for Action and Research in the 1990s she became one of Singapore's most widely-respected commentators on women's issues.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Two individuals who have certainly left a permanent mark on Singapore's landscape are Wong Mun Summ and Richard Hassell. These Singapore-based architects are known for a variety of eye-catching designs, ranging from tall, ultra-contemporary condominium buildings, to a grandiose churches. Equally at home when designing properties for railway stations or for holiday resorts, this dynamic duo's work features in Singapore, Bali, Bangkok and China.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">The arts have flourished in this particular corner of South East Asia for a considerable time. Foremost amongst the influential Singaporeans who have focused on local tastes is Philip Cheah. In the 1980s, Singapore was regarded as something of a cultural backwater, with little to inspire the creatively-minded. Together with his brother Michael, Philip embarked on creating the &lsquo;BigO', a magazine that championed local talent amongst musicians and artists of all shades. While he was director of the Singapore International film Festival in the 1990s, Cheah placed the spotlight on dynamic young Singaporean filmmakers, single-handedly rejuvenating the local movie industry.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph2">Prior to his death in 2008 at the grand old age of 82, J B Jeyaretnam (or JBJ as he was affectionately nicknamed) was a tireless campaigner for Singapore democracy. His son Kenneth said: &ldquo;My father demonstrated that democracy means the right to change government if you are not satisfied with it&rdquo;. His dignified approach to the city state's politics won him the respect of colleagues and political opponents in equal measures.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">According to statistics, Singapore's main airport, Changi, welcomed over 51 million passengers through its doors last year. As the hub for a variety of major airlines, including Jetstar Asia Airways, SilkAir, Singapore Airlines, Tigerair, Valuair and Scoot, Changi is currently the second busiest airport in the Asian continent; indeed, it ranks as seventh most-visited airport anywhere on the globe.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelourplanet/9774032901/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="285" alt="" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/changi-airport-singapore.jpg" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Changi's three passenger terminals have a total handling capacity of 66 million, which is welcome news for the airport's management teams since last year's passenger figures were 10% up on the previous year. In addition to the phenomenal amounts of air travelers using Changi, it is also one of the world's busiest cargo hubs, handling 1.8 million tonnes last year.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">For such a bustling airport, attention to customer service has always been paramount. Changi has won an incredible 430+ awards since opening in 1981, including no fewer than 30 &lsquo;Best Airport' awards in 2012. But the good news for the vast numbers of passengers who continue to use this airport is that complacency is never on the agenda. Despite all the accolades, the management at Changi remain determined to out-do previous achievements. Upgrades to the airport are an ongoing task, whether to improve existing facilities or to build new ones which are even more customer-friendly.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">To this end, the airport launched a feedback system three years ago. This was aimed at allowing customers to gauge the airport's performance in a number of key areas. Visitors completing the feedback forms were asked to rate staff and facilities. In addition, a real-time inspection system was launched, with a view to monitoring any potential faults in the airport.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Since the system was launched in 2010, it has been regarded as an unparalleled success. In fact, maintenance costs at the airport have been cut by more than $ 2 million, with response time to repairs slashed by 30%.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph2">The revolutionary E-inspection system allows maintenance workers to report any issues to contractors using smart phones that have been installed with highly-specialized software.  In this way they can keep tabs on the progress of any repair simply by referring to a hand-held device. As well as monitoring repairs, the feedback system also allows visitors to rate a diverse cross-section of the airport staff. From immigration officers to counter staff to cleaners, customers can now give constructive feedback on every aspect of <a target='_blank' href="http://www.changiairport.com/" target="_blank">Changi</a>'s widespread operations.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">The riots that convulsed Little India late in 2013 are still leaving an indelible mark. While the chaotic disturbances were brought under control by a controlled police response, the repercussions of the ugly scenes are lasting considerably longer.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/navalsurfaceforces/9267950061/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/teo-chee-hean-home-affairs-minister-singapore.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Singapore is certainly not used to such civil disobedience. The whole situation was prompted when an Indian migrant worker was struck and killed by a bus. Crowds of his fellow construction workers, many of whom had been drinking for some time, appear to have used the tragic accident as an excuse to cause wanton mayhem on the streets of Singapore. Some of them began throwing missiles at the police who had gathered to try and defuse the situation. In the ensuing riots, several police cars and an ambulance were set alight.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Order was restored, with many Singaporeans left baffled by the unexpected  outbreak of violence that had occurred in the heart of their normally peace-loving city. It is testament to the resolve of Singapore's citizens that the streets were cleared of debris very swiftly and the shops which had been affected by the rioting opened for business the following day.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">All the media reporting on the events were unanimous in their verdict that this was, in all likelihood, a unique incident. However, the authorities have let it be known that they are determined to get to the root of what prompted a section of Singapore society to act in this way. After all, the Indian migrant community are not exactly strangers to the city; many of these workers have been living in Singapore for a long time, having been made more than welcome for the skills they continue bringing to the city. The degree of their integration has, until now, been taken for granted.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The Singapore government have decided to appoint a special committee to investigate the riots that occurred in Little India. This committee of inquiry has been instigated due to the levels of violence experienced on Singapore streets &ndash; estimated to be the worst case of rioting since 1969.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">Teo Chee Hean, Home Affairs Minister, set up the four-man committee, with orders to report their findings within six months. It has also been announced that the chairman of the investigatory committee will be a former judge of Singapore's Supreme Court, G Pannir Selvam. The members acting alongside him will be an ex-police commissioner, Tee Tu Bia, a former trade union president, John De Pavya, and a citizens committee consultant, Andrew Chua Thiam Chwee.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Many movie-goers delight in the escapism of martial arts. Watching athletic antagonists wielding swords while undertaking death-defying acrobatics, is a popular slice of cinema escapism. However, it is somewhat more intimidating to come across a samurai warrior in real life.</div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">But this is the situation that occurred on Singapore's bustling Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) rail network in Dec last year. As commuters boarded their usual train, expecting an unremarkable commute, they were somewhat taken aback when a man clambered aboard wielding a samurai sword. Having jumped the &lsquo;fare gate' at Paya Lebar station, he joined the westbound train, leaving a trail of bemused onlookers in his wake.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">According to an official MRT spokesman: &ldquo;the male passenger was apprehended at 12:45 PM around Bugis MRT station and the incident is now under police investigation&rdquo;.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">As with any dramatic incident in the modern age, the unfolding events were captured on mobile phones. A bank executive who happened to witness the incident recorded a brief video of the samurai warrior exiting, perhaps to do battle with evil forces at some pre-arranged destination?</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Naturally, the sight of someone in possession of a large fearsome-looking blade in somewhere as densely-populated as Singapore never goes unnoticed for very long. Thankfully the culprit was soon being tailed by three transit security officers, hanging onto his every suspicious movement. Witnesses described the strange man calmly chatting to his pursuers; although what was being discussed, or in what language, was less apparent. Apparently this sense of calm was strained to say the least, with bystanders describing the blade carrying individual as becoming increasingly agitated. Eventually he drew his weapon and began pointing it towards the uniformed men.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">He was described as being middle-aged, and slightly overweight. His hair was dyed and permed, and he was sporting the traditional Japanese &lsquo;hakama' garment.</div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">During their fraught experience, none of the 30 or so passengers sharing his train compartment said anything to him. The mysterious case came to its  conclusion when the weird swordsman was finally apprehended by the police. When he clambered off the train at Dhoby Grant station, it appeared that the officers, who had perhaps been adopting a &lsquo;softly softly' approach for fear of unsettling the antagonist beside so many passers-by, decided to take action.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph2">Again, in similar fashion to the recent disturbances in Little India, the reason this particular incident has caused waves in social media is because of its unique, isolated nature. Singaporeans are used to seeing many colourful and good natured people during their daily life, so a lone idiot brandishing an offensive weapon naturally sticks out like a sore thumb.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">While Singapore has been keen to embrace much of what the west has to offer in terms of business models, technological advances, fashion and numerous other influences, it appears that one particular aspect has taken things too far. Ashley Madison is an internet dating site with a twist. Unlike the many others clogging the search engines, devoted to introducing singletons to the partners of their dreams, this particular website targets people who are already in relationships. Basically, Ashley Madison is all about extramarital dating &ndash; in other words, encouraging anyone who has ever harboured thoughts of having illicit affairs to take the steps to go down that route.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teakwood/7914086914/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporenewsblog.com/upload/userfiles/ashley-madison-dating-site.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">For all its vibrant culture and booming economic activity, Singaporeans remain fairly conservative, particularly when it comes to relationships and sex. For this reason, the plans that Ashley Madison have recently made to launch their Singapore version have sparked widespread outcry.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">The Ashley Madison tagline is blunt, brazen and to the point. &ldquo;Life is too short. Have an affair&rdquo;. While this may or may not be tongue-in-cheek, it is the very immoral nature of a website that appears to condone adultery that has raised hackles in Singapore.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">Launched in 2001 and based in Canada, Ashley Madison count their membership in the tens of millions (in fact, as at October 2013 the total number of users was listed at 22 million and rising). Available online in English, Chinese, French, Italian and a range of other languages, the only Asian outlets where it has currently running outlets are Japan, India and Hong Kong. Obviously, Singapore, a booming Asian economy with millions of intelligent, web-savvy internet surfers, is regarded as a potential goldmine.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">But local opposition has proved to be unequivocal. Both residents and politicians alike have united in opposing the plans. Singapore's minister for social and family development, Chan Chun Sing, was quick to voice his fears. &ldquo;I do not welcome the website in Singapore. I'm against any company or website that harms marriage&rdquo;. Using a Facebook feed, he went on to reiterate his position on family values. &ldquo;Promoting infidelity undermines trust and commitment between a husband and wife, which is core to marriage&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">Although Singapore is an open and welcoming society, it is also known for its stricter social morals.  Perhaps if Ashley Madison's management had done their research more thoroughly, flags would've been raised about the likelihood of a fairly conservative nation embracing this adultery-themed site.</div>
