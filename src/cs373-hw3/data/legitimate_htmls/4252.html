                                <em class="title">“What ingredients are in your coconut oil?”</em>
                                <p>The only ingredient in Nutiva's coconut oil is…organic, unrefined coconut oil. Nutiva's coconut oil comes from organic coconuts harvested from a small farm in the Philippines. As soon as the coconuts are harvested, the flesh is scooped out by hand and cold-pressed into coconut oil. Unlike other brands, Nutiva's coconut oil is never bleached, deodorized, or refined.</p>

                                <em class="title">“Why should I eat coconut oil?”</em>
                                <p>Nutiva's Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is the highest quality available, at the best possible price. But more than that, when you purchase from Thrive Market, you’re supporting a sustainable food system with ethical practices. Plus, for every member who joins Thrive Market, we donate a free membership to someone in need of healthy living.</p>

                                <em class="title">“What nutrients are in coconut oil?”</em>
                                <p>Coconut oil is full of healthy fats, including lauric acid, a medium-chain triglyceride. This healthy fat may be beneficial to weight loss, can help lower cholesterol, and provides the body with a direct source of energy.</p>

                                <em class="title">“Is your coconut oil certified organic?”</em>
                                <p>Yes, Nutiva's coconut oil is certified organic. This means no pesticides or genetically modified organisms were used in the farming or production of the coconuts used to make this oil.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></span></p>

Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.&nbsp; Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren&rsquo;t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.&nbsp; We may also use it to improve the Services &ndash; for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><em>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</em></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.&nbsp; Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites.&nbsp; Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4"><strong>Will Thrive Market Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone.&nbsp; However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>Information that&rsquo;s no longer personally identifiable.&nbsp; </strong>We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (&ldquo;Advertisers&rdquo;) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.&nbsp; Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.&nbsp; Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</span></p>
