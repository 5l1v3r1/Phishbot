If everyone is living better than&hellip;","content":"\n<p>Income inequality in the US has increased in the last few decades, but inequality and well being are different. If everyone is living better than before, the fact that some people are much better off isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. The recent inequality has been a problem because, at least in income terms, a few have prospered while most stagnated. But income does not tell us much about living standards. Anecdotally it seems like living standards increased for everyone since the 1970s. Once, hardly anyone had air-conditioning, now everyone has mobile phones. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/business\/the_united_states_of_debt\/2016\/05\/overspending_isn_t_why_americans_are_in_debt_an_excerpt_from_elizabeth_warren.html\">Others argue<\/a> the poor are struggling like never before.<\/p>\n<p>An article in the <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.30.2.3\">latest version <\/a>of the American Economic Review finds that Americans&rsquo; consumption has become more unequal too: The amount high-earning Americans spend grew much more than that of low income earners in the last 30 years. But that does not mean low earners are worse off. The figure below shows the share of low and high earners who own goods that used to be considered luxury items. Despite more inequality, low income Americans have better access to dishwashers, laundry, and entertainment goods.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"image-678935\" class=\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\"><img src=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-06-at-9-37-46-am.png?w=497\" data-retina=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-06-at-9-37-46-am.png?w=497\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><\/figure><p>So where does the increase in spending inequality coming from? To some extent it comes down to quality&mdash;high earners are more likely to have sub-zero refrigerators and multiple large screen TVs. Low earners also spend much less on food. The figure below charts a large increase in equality in money spent on food&mdash;even after including food stamps.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"image-678937\" class=\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\"><img src=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-6-51-32-am.png?w=508\" data-retina=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-6-51-32-am.png?w=508\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><\/figure><p>The difference in food spending between the rich and poor has widened since the 1970s. It probably reflects that poor Americans consume lower quality food, contributing to higher rates of obesity and early <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/research\/opinions\/2016\/02\/22-growing-life-expectancy-gap-burtless\">mortality<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a widening disparity in leisure. All Americans work fewer hours than they used to, but low earners work <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/574693\/americans-working-less-than-ever-before\/\">much less than before<\/a>. Leisure inequality followed the opposite trend of income inequality, where the poor work less and the rich work more. More leisure time would seem to make the poor better off because leisure is presumed to be preferable to work. But it is not clear if the decline in work is voluntary or from fewer opportunities. If low earners are working less because they have fewer hours offered to them, more leisure is another indicator of polarization and families struggling to get by<strong>.<\/strong> The study also considers difference in quality time. Everyone is enjoying more active leisure time (volunteering and sports), but less educated Americans are spending most of their new leisure time passively (sleeping, watching TV).<\/p>\n<figure id=\"image-679119\" class=\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\"><img src=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-9-42-20-am.png?w=500\" data-retina=\"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/screen-shot-2016-05-09-at-9-42-20-am.png?w=500\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><\/figure><p>The data from the study suggest high earners not only have more income relative to low earners, but also more material well-being. Even if they aren&rsquo;t spending as much, in many ways low earners are better off too. They have access to more goods and leisure time than ever before, though each appear to be lower quality than what high earners consume. And while income and wealth may not factor directly into economist&rsquo;s measure of well-being, widening income disparities can mean a thinner financial cushion, greater insecurity, and more stress.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679539,"alt":"","title":"RTX15X0E","caption":"Even when everyone has access to modern &quot;luxury&quot;

It must prevent companies that haven&rsquo;t been approved by the government from being promoted, and clean up the health-care ads in its search results. Paid-for promotions should not consist of more than 30% of search results per page, and they should be more clearly marked as ads.

So far, doctors have only been able to definitively detect the virus when they can send blood samples to a specialized lab for difficult genetic testing.<\/p>\n<p>But now, researchers from a large collective of universities including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and the University of Toronto have developed an easy way to detect Zika in about an hour. Their research was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell\/fulltext\/S0092-8674(16)30505-0\">published<\/a> today (May 9) in Cell.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In response to an emerging outbreak, we envision a custom-tailored diagnostic system could be ready for use within one week&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; James Collins, a <strong>bio<\/strong>medical engineer at Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard and lead author of the paper, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/story\/2016\/05\/paper-disc-can-quickly-detect-zika-virus-in-the-field\/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05.09.2016%20(1)\">said in a press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Building upon <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bu.edu\/research\/articles\/paper-gene-circuit\/\">research<\/a> that had been done in the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the team created a paper-based test that changes color when it detects Zika in a sample of blood, urine, or saliva. The test is able to replicate strains of genetic material found in a sample. If any of the genetic sequences are unique to Zika, the paper test will <a href=\"http:\/\/sciencenewsjournal.com\/simple-affordable-diagnostic-platform-detect-zika-virus\/\">turn purple<\/a> positive result.<\/p>\n<p>In theory, this kind of testing is as easy to use as a home pregnancy test and costs less than a dollar per test. Researchers hope that because this test is so inexpensive and easy to use, it will be widely available in areas with fewer resources.<\/p>\n<p>Although there&#8217;s no specific treatment for Zika, Keith Pardee, a pharmacists at the University of Toronto and co-author of the paper, said that he hope that this test will at least help contain the outbreak in countries where it is most prevalent

Is this the incumbency speaking? And my name isn&rsquo;t Marie Antoinette.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I might get in trouble for this, but I&rsquo;d like to add a drop of customer experience into the boiling broth of opinions about Uber. No warranties expressed or implied, my perspective is a limited one.<\/p>\n<p>After five decades of riding in taxis, both in my native Paris and my adopted Bay Area, I&rsquo;ve had my share of interesting and sympathetic cabbies, most of whom are more than willing to share their life stories. There was the elegantly-named Pantaleon de Roudneff, a white Russian who started driving Paris cabs during World War I. Sixty years later, then in his eighties, he wove uncertainly across the lanes of Paris&rsquo; <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boulevard_P%C3%A9riph%C3%A9rique\">P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique ring boulevard<\/a> as he told me about people fighting, dying, giving birth&mdash;or taking steps towards one&mdash;in the back of his cab. I offered to ghostwrite his memoirs but he wasn&rsquo;t interested.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, pleasant rides with charming drivers are rare exceptions in a succession of dirty Silicon Valley cabs with cracked windshields, duct taped seats, and noisy wheel bearings threatening to seize at any minute. In Paris, artful cabbies need to be reminded that I&rsquo;m not a visitor who needs a tour of the city. Sitting in the back, I squirm each time the cabbie plays with the zone setting on the &ldquo;grinder,&rdquo; as Parisians call the meter, a sentiment Woody Allen immortalized <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=4qMFRNRFB_cC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=you%27re+so+beautiful+I+can%27t+keep+my+eye+on+the+meter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1hmP8kCTS&amp;sig=K0Yctxleif8kq4vqFO2J08ysuYo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDo6H6qMnMAhULwWMKHWEHBW8Q6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q\">in <\/a><em><a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=4qMFRNRFB_cC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=you%27re+so+beautiful+I+can%27t+keep+my+eye+on+the+meter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t1hmP8kCTS&amp;sig=K0Yctxleif8kq4vqFO2J08ysuYo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDo6H6qMnMAhULwWMKHWEHBW8Q6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q\">Annie Hall<\/a><\/em>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful I can hardly keep my eyes on the meter.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>Simply finding a cab can be an unpleasant, complicated experience. Try getting a ride at the wrong time of day, when it&rsquo;s raining, in the wrong part of town, or for a destination that&rsquo;s unlikely to provide a return fare. And there are other considerations outside of my range: I have no personal knowledge, as counsel would say, of being denied a ride because of my skin color or, more recently, the wrong headgear&mdash;but we&rsquo;ve all <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2015\/10\/why-i-still-get-shunned-by-taxi-drivers\/411583\/\">heard the stories<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The memories must be deeply imprinted. After three years of Uber use in the Bay Area and in Paris, I still marvel at the simplicity of the experience. A few taps on your smartphone, up pops a picture of the car and the driver, you track the approach, hop in, hop out, no cash, no credit card&hellip; done. No trouble with rain, destination, or ethnicity&mdash;and my US Uber account also works in Paris, Bordeaux, or Marseilles.<\/p>\n<p>The phrase &ldquo;transforming experience&rdquo; was first used, and then abused, in Hollywood when describing the requirements for a script. According to the orthodoxy, a movie won&rsquo;t fly unless the lead goes through a transforming experience, one that indelibly stamps her life.<\/p>\n<p>In moderation, the phrase applies to the way Uber has made my family&rsquo;s life different. Silicon Valley argot says <em>removing friction<\/em>, a good description. In Paris, my wife Brigitte remotely sets up a ride from a close suburb to our Left Bank place for her 85-year-old mother, and then calls the driver to explain that he may need to wait for a bit at the curb while her mother comes downstairs. Brigitte follows the car&rsquo;s progress and prepares her mother&rsquo;s descent.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>Try doing that with a Paris cab.<\/p>\n<p>In San Francisco, with its expensive parking fees and fines, with traffic that&rsquo;s much more painful and congested than in our leafy Palo Alto, Uber is a salvation. When we first had a place in San Francisco eleven years ago, getting a cab was such a chore that we mostly gave up. Now, we park the car for the weekend and navigate the city by foot and Uber. Some riders may object to Uber&rsquo;s surge pricing, but they forget how it felt to wave desperately from the curb as cabs passed by during rush hour or after a well-attended event.<\/p>\n<p>As it has for so many, Uber has become, for us, a pleasant habit, a verb: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Uber it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It all seems so normal that one starts to wonder why it took so long. All the ingredients required to build a 21st century cab company had long been on the shelf <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travis_Kalanick\">before Travis Kalanick<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Garrett_Camp\">and Garrett Camp<\/a> started <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uber_%28company%29\">Uber in 2009<\/a>: GPS, smartphones, Cloud services, and the wireless internet. The taxi companies had the time, money, and access to technology to modernize&mdash;and now they rage at an interloper for &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, this isn&rsquo;t so puzzling. Cab companies live in close symbiosis with municipalities that provide protective regulation&mdash;a circumlocution to avoid the libelous <em>mafia<\/em> when describing such crusty incumbents. In France, one <a href=\"https:\/\/fr.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taxis_G7\">taxi company, Taxis G7<\/a>, received government permission to operate as a result of CEO Andr&eacute; Rousselet&rsquo;s close relationship with president Mitterrand. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gauche_caviar\">the caviar left<\/a> version of crony capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>A key protection offered by local governments is the limit on the number of taxi licenses in a given territory. These <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taxicabs_of_the_United_States\">licenses, or medallions<\/a>, once sported huge price tags: In New York City, a medallion could cost <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2015\/07\/21\/news\/companies\/nyc-yellow-taxi-uber\/\">more than one million dollars<\/a>. Alternatively, you could lease a cab from a medallion owner and then hope<em> <\/em>to get enough rides day in, day out to make rent. How is this better than being an Uber driver, able to work part- or full-time? Or to independently switch between Uber and, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lyft\">its competitor Lyft<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the city, purchasing a medallion means a crushing amount of debt. Taxi drivers have long depended on their medallions&rsquo; resale value for their retirement&hellip;and they now see Uber severely depreciating their nest eggs.<\/p>\n<p>The cabbies complain about unfair competition and have begun to protest by <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/01\/26\/following-anti-uber-protest-french-government-announces-yet-another-law\/\">blocking freeways and burning tires<\/a>. After a series of vigorous demonstrations, the French government announced that it would buy back taxi drivers&rsquo; <em>plaques <\/em>(as the licenses are called in my native Paris). The clever trick is that the repurchase would be financed by a tax on taxi revenues. Think about the sleight of hand for a moment: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll first take your money to pay you back later.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is often criticized for raising huge amounts of money (more than $10 billion so far, at a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-03\/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation\">$62.5 billion valuation<\/a>), and for his aggressive, border-line illegal tactics. There&rsquo;s a hackneyed joke floating around the Valley: Uber CEO Kalanick doesn&rsquo;t brush his teeth in the morning, he files them. We ought to be grateful for his aggressive tactics: Do critics think Uber would have gotten this far by politely asking for permission to play in the municipalities-backed taxi monopolies&rsquo; sandbox?<\/p>\n<p>Regarding the controversy over how Uber treats its drivers: <a href=\"http:\/\/uberpeople.net\/threads\/slave-labor-at-the-very-least.23593\/\">The forums may<\/a> light up with accusations of slavery, but while many Uber drivers&rsquo; circumstances are less-than-cushy, I don&rsquo;t see how the life of a rent-to-drive cabbie is much better. Also, Uber has given some unemployed people a first job that they couldn&rsquo;t get before. Even in countries, such as France, that have a more generous unemployment safety net, a number of young people prefer the challenge of driving for Uber to staying on unemployment rolls. I&rsquo;ve ridden with some of them.<\/p>\n<p><em>This post originally appeared at <a href=\"https:\/\/mondaynote.com\/in-praise-of-uber-ad056ec1e16#.azwvvshlb\">Monday Note<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679066,"alt":"uber ceo","title":"UBER-CEO","caption":"&quot;I&#039;ll Uber it.&quot;","credit":"Reuters\/Danish Siddiqui","size":"extra-large","thumbnail":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=270&h=152&crop=1","square":{"mobile":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=300&crop=1","mobile_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=600&h=600&crop=1","tablet":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=600&h=600&crop=1","tablet_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1200&h=1200&crop=1","desktop":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=900&h=900&crop=1","desktop_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1800&h=1800&crop=1"},"square_landscape":{"mobile":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=320","mobile_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=640","tablet":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=768","tablet_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1536","desktop":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600","desktop_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=3200"},"src":{"mobile":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=320","mobile_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=640","tablet":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=768","tablet_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1536","desktop":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1600","desktop_2x":"https:\/\/qzprod.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/uber-ceo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=3200"}},"facebookDescription":"I might get in trouble for this, but I\u2019d like to add a drop of customer experience into the boiling broth of opinions about Uber.","edition":"global","taxonomies":{"kicker":[{"name":"Uber = Super","slug":"uber-super"}],"tags":[{"name":"economics","slug":"economics"},{"name":"France","slug":"france"},{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas"},{"name":"Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e","slug":"jean-louis-gassee"},{"name":"labor","slug":"labor"},{"name":"labor rights","slug":"labor-rights"},{"name":"monday note","slug":"monday-note"},{"name":"Paris","slug":"paris"},{"name":"politics","slug":"politics"},{"name":"repubs","slug":"repubs"},{"name":"Silicon Valley","slug":"silicon-valley"},{"name":"taxis","slug":"taxis"},{"name":"tech","slug":"tech"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"technology"},{"name":"Uber","slug":"uber"},{"name":"work","slug":"work"}],"topic":[{"name":"Politics and Policy","slug":"politics-and-policy-t"}]},"kicker":"Uber = Super","byline":{"contributors":1,"authors":[{"contributor":true,"name":"Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e","bio":"Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e is a venture partner with Allegis Capital in Silicon Valley.

It is intended to allow a company to message back and forth with customers to help them identify flaws and provide guidance.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>In all, more than 100 messages were sent to the thread and seemingly automatically created other threads when replies took a certain format. Those messages include ones apparently sent by a sort of auto responder, leading to a flood of echoes on top of the flood of messages.<\/p>\n<p>Atlassian told Quartz that &ldquo;JIRA Service Desk is designed to share information within a trusted network,&rdquo; in an emailed statement &ldquo;We&rsquo;re exploring ways to address this issue and are committed to preventing the abuse of our services.&rdquo; Ironically, Atlassian may have been slow to respond to the hack because it was unable to view the offending ticket due to a lack of permission to see items in its customers&rsquo; accounts&mdash;in most circumstances an admirable policy.<\/p>\n<p>The ticket was created on the portal used by RebelMouse a &ldquo;publishing platform built and optimized for social media distribution&rdquo; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/273440\/facebook-brings-rebelmouse-to-instant-articles.html\">according to its CEO<\/a>. A product manager at RebelMouse, Torsten Sandor, said in an email, &ldquo;Our JIRA setup failed us, and we are working on a fix.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Sandor did not respond to questions about if or how the RebelMouse account was compromised nor if RebelMouse&rsquo;s JIRA Service Desk preferences had been customized to allow anyone to create a ticket and subscribe others.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>It would appear that Bourdine was able to create a ticket on RebelMouse&rsquo;s portal of Atlassian&rsquo;s software and then subscribe 496 other email addresses to the thread.<\/p>\n<p>The ticket now appears to be deleted, so the flood of email may be over. But the circumstances were all the more frustrating for people caught on the thread because there was no easy way to unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<p>All of this could have been prevented if Atlasssian confirmed that email addresses entered into its ticketing system were being properly subscribed or if the company allowed for simpler ways to unsubscribe from tickets.<\/p>\n<p>However it did not require any confirmation from the people behind the email addresses added to the ticket that they wanted to be notified of the issue or that they wished to receive updates via email.<\/p>\n<p>These kinds of confirmations are industry best practice. Websites large and small use them to combat spam and harassment techniques that developed in some of the earliest days of the web.<\/p>\n<p>The emails sent by Atlassian&rsquo;s servers to alert people of JIRA Service Desk ticket updates do not contain a link to unsubscribe from notifications nor to remove the recipient from the the ticket.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, somehow JIRA Service Desk accounts were created for all of the email address added to the ticket without the email account holder&rsquo;s permission. To change their notification preferences&mdash;on the account they didn&rsquo;t know they even had&mdash;people on the thread are able to log into the service by resetting this automatically created account&rsquo;s password.<\/p>\n<p>Once logged it is possible to unsubscribe from requests, but that didn&rsquo;t end up working reliably.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data->\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryanscherf\">@ryanscherf<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shanndfox\">@shanndfox<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/slashpixels\">@slashpixels<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JIRA\">@JIRA<\/a> tried that, but with everyone replying directly to the emails it keeps creating new requests&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Jon Phillips (@jophillips) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jophillips\/status\/729458908994097152\">May 8, 2016<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data->\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KatherineCory\">@KatherineCory<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/slashpixels\">@slashpixels<\/a> Been trying to block it but still somehow it still gets through.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; A4man (@A4manArtist) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/A4manArtist\/status\/729375517581971458\">May 8, 2016<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<p>It was also possible change where notification emails are sent, including addresses to accounts that do not belong to the user or accounts that do not actually exist, since Atlassian doesn&rsquo;t appear to confirm email addresses before they are added into the messaging system.<\/p>\n<p>It is unclear where this list of email addresses came from or why they are associated with each other.

It is whether we are moving toward a severe supply crunch, or a much longer period of glut.<\/p>\n<p>Who is right will be important to the future stability of petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, along with giant companies including ExxonMobil, BP and Schlumberger. It&rsquo;ll also determine whether relatively low oil prices will continue, or prices will spike.<\/p>\n<p>The debate hinges on two factors: a steep drop in oil exploration by companies struggling with low prices, and the possible mainstream rise of electric cars that do not burn gasoline.<\/p>\n<p>The first trend&mdash;spending cutbacks, including $91 billion in <a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Crude-Oil\/91-Billion-In-Capex-Cuts-A-Serious-Hangover-For-Oil.html\">capital expenditure reductions<\/a> by oil companies this year alone&mdash;leads forecasters such as IHS and WoodMacKenzie to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/1a6c6032-1521-11e6-9d98-00386a18e39d.html#axzz489fmVu1b\">predict an oil shortage<\/a> (paywall) by the middle of the next decade. If the trend proceeds without change, by 2035, supply will be 4.5 million barrels a day short of demand, says WoodMac.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>There is no doubting that the spending cutbacks, if unchanged, will lead to a supply shortfall. And that that could lead to a serious spike in oil prices.<\/p>\n<p>But working against a price hike is a possible surge in electric car ownership. In February, Bloomberg New Energy Finance <a href=\"http:\/\/about.bnef.com\/press-releases\/electric-vehicles-to-be-35-of-global-new-car-sales-by-2040\/\">released a report<\/a> forecasting a plunge in the production cost of electric cars in the next decade. By 2035, it said, lower sticker prices will lead electric cars to comprise about 30% of all new car sales. That would lead to a drop in oil demand of 6 to 8 million barrels a day by the middle of the 2030s, according to BNEF&rsquo;s Colin McKerracher.<\/p>\n<p>If the BNEF forecast is right, the supply glut would persist, not vanish, and oil prices would remain depressed.<\/p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia appears at minimum to be hedging&mdash;and may be leaning toward the latter camp. On May 7, <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/678568\/we-could-be-in-for-an-even-wilder-ride-on-oil-prices-now-that-a-30-year-old-saudi-prince-is-in-charge\/\">Saudi announced<\/a> a flurry of new decrees that further cemented the policies of prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the king.<\/p>\n<p>The powerful deputy crown prince rejects the conventional belief that oil in the ground is like money in the bank, and instead wants to keep production high for now, and thus earn as much profit from the kingdom&rsquo;s oil as possible. In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2016-04-21\/the-2-trillion-project-to-get-saudi-arabia-s-economy-off-oil\">recent interviews<\/a>, prince Mohammed has suggested a belief that oil is becoming a much less strategic commodity, and that Saudi Arabia must diversify. His decrees illustrate his determination to move the kingdom away from what he considers an unreliable oil economy.<\/p>\n<p>Some independent analysts think he&rsquo;s right.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;A few years from now, oil speculation will be as &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; as speculating on wheat, paper, or corn,&rdquo; said Omar Al-Ubaydli, a fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679056,"alt":"Saudi Arabia&#039;s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman looks at a document as Saudi Arabia&#039;s cabinet agrees to implement a broad reform plan

Unlike the contingent of extreme <a href=\"http:\/\/hackaday.com\/2015\/10\/12\/cyberpunk-yourself-body-modification-augmentation-and-grinders\/\">biohackers<\/a> or &ldquo;grinders,&rdquo; the 30-year old Spanish avant-garde artist&rsquo;s superpower&mdash;or self-imposed aberration&mdash;is not immediately obvious. Ribas has a tiny magnet near the crook of her elbow that allows her to feel all tremors and earthquakes anywhere on earth, in real time.<\/p>\n<p>Like her longtime artistic partner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color?language=en\">Neil Harbisson<\/a>, who has a color-sensing antenna permanently attached to his cranium, Ribas says the external physical change is not the point of being a cyborg. &ldquo;I modified my body, to modify my mind,&rdquo; says Ribas. As you can see in the video above, she translates the tremors she feels in her arm into dance movements.<\/p>\n<p>But why the need for the surgically-implanted body hack?<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to perceive movement in a deeper way, &ldquo; explains Ribas, a choreographer who studied movement at Dartington College in London. &ldquo;The planet moves, constantly shaking and moving everyday. I thought it would be amazing to translate the massive and natural movements of the planet in a different way.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>Ribas&rsquo; subdermal implant receives data from a custom iPhone app that aggregates seismic activity from geological monitors around the world. She describes the physical sensation as akin to having a phone vibrate in your pocket. The stronger the quake, the stronger the vibration.<\/p>\n<p>During the 7.8 earthquake that devastated parts of Nepal last year, strong vibrations pulsating in Ribas&rsquo; arm woke her in the middle of the night. &ldquo;It felt very weird, like I was there,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I feel connected to the people who suffer through an earthquake.&rdquo; This &ldquo;seismic sense,&rdquo; has become like her second heartbeat, says Ribas.<\/p>\n<p>Having been attuned to the shifts and grumblings of tectonic plates for the last three years, Ribas says earthquakes are misunderstood. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s unfair that our perception of earthquakes are all bad. Earthquakes are part of the evolution of our planet. The bad thing is that humans haven&rsquo;t adapted to this natural phenomenon,&rdquo; she muses. Ribas says that if only city planners had a deeper understanding of the science of earthquakes, maybe large cities would not have been built above active tectonic plates. &ldquo;We still need to learn how to live in our own planet.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>To sharpen her seismic sense, Ribas is considering getting implants on her feet so she could immediately discern where earthquakes occur in the world. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll use each toe to define each continent, but that&rsquo;s still in process,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Ribas and Harbisson are looking to collaborate with engineers and technologists to improve their cybernetic implants.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":678122,"alt":"","title":"Moon Ribas","caption":"","credit":"Adam

Thirty deep wounds all over. Private parts slashed over 20&hellip;","content":"\n<p>The body of the 29-year-old lies in a pool of blood in a shack-like house. Thirty deep wounds all over. Private parts slashed over 20 times. Stab wounds on the back of her head, on the chest, chin, and cheek. Intestines pulled out by an iron rod thrust into the vagina, chest torn open by stabs.<\/p>\n<p>And it is not 6 pm yet. She lies dead for over two hours before her mom returned after the day&rsquo;s labour.<\/p>\n<p>The mother&rsquo;s blood-curdling cries for help are met with dull thuds&mdash;neighbours&rsquo; doors being shut. The police do not arrive for another two hours. Once in, they take a look at the body using the light from mobile phones, and leave. The crime scene is not cordoned off. No policeman is posted on guard, no higher official informed.<\/p>\n<p>It is noontime next day before the body is taken for post-mortem. The autopsy is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deccanchronicle.com\/nation\/crime\/060516\/kerala-rape-case-controversy-over-who-did-autopsy-on-jisha.html\">allegedly performed<\/a> by a student. After the procedure, the body is hurriedly cremated as directed by the police.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>This is not a scene from some seedy crime thriller. This rape and murder took place in Perumbavoor, Ernakulam, in the southern Indian state of Kerala on April 28. &ldquo;Jisha murder&rdquo;, as it is now known in India, has become yet another case study in how to botch up a rape investigation with brutal insensitivity and criminal negligence.<\/p>\n<p>A day after her killing, local dailies carried the news in small columns in obit pages, revealing her name and other details&mdash;evidently fed by the police&mdash;but omitting the fact that she was raped. It gained traction in national media the following day after someone noticed chilling similarities with the December 2012 gangrape of 23-year old Jyoti Singh in New Delhi.<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><span>The police take a look at the body using the light from mobile phones, and leave. <\/span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.in\/2016\/05\/05\/keralas-nirbhaya_n_9845514.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kerala&rsquo;s Nirbhaya<\/a>,&rdquo; they called this one. (The victim in the Delhi bus rape case was called &ldquo;Nirbhaya&rdquo; by sections of the Indian media.) Soon, news channels picked it up and social media outrage followed. Once the gravity of the situation was brought out, media coverage turned extensive. More details began tumbling out.<\/p>\n<p>Jisha was a law student, the younger daughter of a single mother. Her sister married away, she lived with her mother in a single-room house&mdash;the family&rsquo;s home for the past 40 years.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>It was reported that she was earlier assaulted physically by the brother-in-law of the panchayat (village council) member of her locality. She complained to the police on April 17, 2014, saying she faced a threat to her life. The police claimed she was only verbally abused and her complaints were rejected as baseless.<\/p>\n<p>Today, there is no trace of the murderer or murderers. The police have destroyed all evidence, according to the media. Classic.<\/p>\n<p>The police officers&rsquo; insensitivity to Jisha&rsquo;s plight or her first complaint should surprise no one. She was a Dalit. The family lived in poverty&mdash;their house had no toilet and they used a pit dug inside the house to answer nature&rsquo;s call. They didn&rsquo;t have enough food.<\/p>\n<p>The mother, though mentally unstable, worked hard to bring up her two daughters. Jisha struggled to earn a degree and practice law. The neighbours weren&rsquo;t even aware that she was a law student.<\/p>\n<p>Awarded a small plot under a government scheme for the homeless, the mother-daughter duo was building a home for itself&mdash;and all by itself. There was no money to hire construction labourers.<\/p>\n<h2>Different eras, same mindsets<\/h2>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time a sexual crime in Kerala has shocked the country.<strong> <\/strong>In my early years as a journalist, Kerala&rsquo;s first ever trafficking case came to light. The victim, now known as the &ldquo;Suryanelli girl&rdquo;, was a 16-year-old from Suryanelli, Idukki district.<\/p>\n<p>She was trapped by a bus conductor and made part of a sex racket. Sold to 41 men in 40 days, she and her family have harassment faced ever since.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a marked difference in public attitudes to the Suryanelli and Jisha cases.<\/p>\n<p>A total lack of middle-class sympathy for the Suryanelli victim was evident from the beginning. Even the courts asked why she didn&rsquo;t try to escape. Mainstream media and the honourable high court ridiculed her, calling her deviant. A retired judge termed her a &ldquo;child prostitute&rdquo;&mdash;illegal by the sheer coinageof the term.<\/p>\n<p>There is sympathy for Jisha, though, because she was attacked in broad daylight inside her own home. She was not travelling alone. She didn&rsquo;t wear revealing clothes.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, two decades later, most other things remain the same.<\/p>\n<p>In the history of the rape cases in Kerala, rarely have the police, judiciary, and media shown compassion for the victims or their families.<\/p>\n<p>One the day the Suryanelli girl went missing&mdash;January 16, 1996&mdash;her father frantically sought help. Police officials shooed him away saying they had to look for an old jeep that had gone missing on the same day. So the child was not rescued&mdash;at least not before she was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/kerala\/Suryanelli-victim-was-raped-67-times-in-40-days\/2013\/08\/30\/article1758840.ece\" target=\"_blank\">raped 67 times<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When the culprits did let her go, the police advised her father to withdraw the complaint. He refused. The police turned hostile.<\/p>\n<p>The child was asked to come to the police station to record her statement. Physically and psychologically ravaged, she, along with her father, was kept waiting the entire day even as voyeuristic crowds gathered to take a peek at her. This was repeated over days. The policemen seemed to derive pleasure from the onlookers&rsquo; lewd comments.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><span>Why is it that most men in our police force turn so anti-woman, anti-Dalit, and anti-poor?<\/span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>In Jisha&rsquo;s case, the police have been slammed for trying a cover up, especially in view of the May 16 state legislative election. No report was filed with the district collector as is mandatory in the event of the death of a Dalit. The haste with which the body was cremated, leaving no scope for a fresh post-mortem, remains unexplained.<\/p>\n<p>Even after 20 years, which saw open discussions on gender justice and women&rsquo;s rights, misogyny remains deeply embedded in the police.<\/p>\n<p>Why is it that, except for a handful of committed officers, most men in our police force turn so anti-woman, anti-Dalit, and anti-poor? Are they trained this way or do they choose this attitude?<\/p>\n<p>Politicians are no different. They often exhibit savage enthusiasm to turn such cases to their advantage, tarnishing their opponents, who in turn attacked the victims and their families.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, when the Suryanelli victim identified a senior Congress leader&mdash;then a minister in the union cabinet&mdash;as one of her abusers, she was turned into a political tool to attack the Congress party. So, when the Congress-led government returned to power in Kerala, she was framed in a case involving theft at her workplace and jailed.<\/p>\n<p>In Jisha&rsquo;s case, too, politicians are busy shedding ritualistic tears. Promises of secure housing and job for her sister have begun pouring in. The Left-led opposition attacked the Congress-led government over police negligence. The Congress-led ruling front attacked the sitting Left front legislator of the area and the Left-controlled panchayat committee for not lending timely help to the family.<\/p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, more than tracing the culprits, mud-slinging is the focus.<\/p>\n<h2>Women unsafe<\/h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, the number of recorded rapes more than doubled in Kerala <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/politics\/kerala-assembly-polls-jisha-udf-women-safety-ldf-law-student-2766934.html\" target=\"_blank\">to 5,918<\/a> over the past five years. Besides, the number of sexual harassment cases, too, have shot up to 20,201 from 13,381 in the same period.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, only 10% or even fewer cases in Kerala see conviction. Denying and delaying justice in epoch-making rape and sexual harassment cases have contributed to the steep increase in such violence&mdash;both within and outside homes. Add to that, the assaults under the pretext of moral policing.<\/p>\n<p>It was only in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/kerala\/at-a-glance-soumya-rape-and-murder-case\/article2618029.ece\" target=\"_blank\">Soumya rape and murder<\/a> case that the police, politicians, media, and the judiciary, along with the general public, stood together for justice. Death sentence was awarded to the accused, Govindachami, a one-armed non-Malayali thought to be a beggar initially and later found be a hardened criminal.<\/p>\n<p>It is a disturbing thought, though, that had Govindachami been a Malayali, the society may not have stood together.<\/p>\n<h2>Is there hope?<\/h2>\n<p>It is comforting that the ideas of gender justice and gender equality are slowly seeping in through social media, thanks to the work done by feminist groups and women&rsquo;s organisations. Let us hope the mindset that sees a rape victim as a subject of mockery and humiliation will change.<\/p>\n<p>Back to Jisha&mdash;was it a planned rape, accentuated by her caste and class? Considering that rape has nothing to do with sex, and is all about power, violence, and misogyny, isn&rsquo;t it horrendous that it is this society that had bred and raised the culprit too? It is scary that he is still out there, free and unknown.<\/p>\n<p>How many such deaths must we witness? What will be left of us to be shocked?<\/p>\n<p><em>K R Meera is a Kerala-based writer.

The mobile money-transfer service will end June 30.<\/p>\n<p>In South Africa, M-Pesa has failed to amass the number of users it did in Tanzania and Kenya. Launched in 2010, its goal was to reach 10 million users in South Africa in five years. Last year, Vodacom <a href=\"http:\/\/vodacom.onlinereport.co.za\/vodacom_ir_2015\/downloads\/strategic_review\/QA_with_the_CEO_Vodacom_IR_2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> that of its 8 million M-Pesa customers in Africa, one million were registered in South Africa, with only 76,000 active users.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Based on our revised projections and high levels of financial inclusion in South Africa, there is little prospect of the M-Pesa product achieving this in its current format in the mid-term,&rdquo; Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said in a statement.<\/p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"NkejBqG7c\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"230\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.theatlas.com\/i\/atlas_NkejBqG7c.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><\/div>\n<p>Vodacom, a subsidiary of the UK-based Vodafone, said it would continue to offer M-Pesa in markets where banking access remained limited, namely Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>M-Pesa&rsquo;s struggle in South Africa is an outlier in the money-transfer&rsquo;s nearly decade-long success story. M-Pesa has about 16.8 million active users worldwide, facilitating transactions of $1.2 billion each month, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/vodafone-money-idUSL5N0MS2SG20140331\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters<\/a>. M-Pesa remains most successful in Kenya, where it was first founded, but has also gained a foothold in several African countries. M-Pesa has also launched in India and this year entered the European market through Romania.<\/p>\n<p>Faced with a slow uptake after its initial launch in South Africa, Vodacom relaunched the service in 2014, adding services like a PIN-protected Visa card and security chip, but the revamp failed to attract customers. M-Pesa was <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/467887\/why-south-africas-largest-mobile-network-vodacom-failed-to-grow-mpesa\/\" target=\"_blank\">unable to muscle in<\/a> on South Africa&rsquo;s banking market, where about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.finmark.org.za\/finscope-south-africa-2015-consumer-survey-launch-presentation\/\" target=\"_blank\">77% of adults<\/a> already have access to banking services. In under-serviced regions, South Africa&rsquo;s big banks have been setting up small satellite branches and offering their own mobile money-sharing services. Major retailer Shoprite also offers a similar service.<\/p>\n<p>South Africa&rsquo;s onerous administrative requirements in the financial sector likely created an obstacle for M-Pesa. And with marketing and advertising for established banks already ubiquitous in the country, M-Pesa seems to have never really made its presence felt.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bYMaQn\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief<\/a> &mdash; the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.<\/em><\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679092,"alt":"","title":"Logo of M-Pesa&#039;s text message transactions option for mobile phones is seen at a Vodafone shop in Bucharest","caption":"End of the road for M-Pesa in South Africa.

As fears of increasing influence from Beijing grows in Hong Kong, finding out what local companies are actually tracking is more important than ever, they say.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong residents can use the website to create a personal data request that is sent to their carrier. It requests:<\/p>\n<ul><li>call logs<\/li>\n<li>mobile app data<\/li>\n<li>geolocation data<\/li>\n<li>IP address logs<\/li>\n<li>disclosures to third parties<\/li>\n<li>text message information<\/li>\n<li>basic subscriber information<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Since it was started in mid-April, 700 requests have been sent to Hong Kong&rsquo;s telcos, Lokman Tsui, a professor at City University of Hong Kong who co-founded the app said. He spoke with Quartz last week after a panel on privacy held at the university. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p><strong>What made you want to start this project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When we first started this project I asked around to see if anyone had ever done this before in Hong Kong, and everyone said no, which I thought was interesting. We have the right to ask the telco what do you know about me, and no one has done that before.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a law in Hong Kong called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcpd.org.hk\/english\/data_privacy_law\/ordinance_at_a_Glance\/ordinance.html\">Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance<\/a>. One of its key principles is about access and about correction, meaning not only can you access your own information but you can rectify it too. This law has been around for years. There is a form you can send to request access for your data but it&rsquo;s is fairly complicated, it&rsquo;s a couple of pages long.<\/p>\n<p>Our website tries to simplify that process as much as possible. We auto-generate letters to the major telco guys and send a very detailed letter requesting different types of data. Our goal was to understand what data they have, how long they keep it for, and if we can&rsquo;t get it then we want to know why not.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p><strong>How have some of the telcos responded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The law has been around for so long, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem that Hong Kong telcos have a mature process in place to handle these types of requests.<\/p>\n<p>The law stipulates that telcos have to respond to requests for data within 40 days. I&rsquo;m happy to report that all of the telcos have given responses within 40 days. Even if it&rsquo;s not a satisfactory response, at least [they have responded] and that&rsquo;s good.<\/p>\n<p>What has been less good about it is that almost all the telcos started calling our volunteers asking, &ldquo;Why do you want to know this?&rdquo; or saying, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to tell you this.&rdquo; I suspect it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve just never handled these types of requests before.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve yet to receive a complete response with all of the data that is requested. Many telcos will give call logs that show who you&rsquo;ve called, but they can&rsquo;t give us a list of the websites you&rsquo;ve visited or geolocation, even though they track them. That&rsquo;s another example of immaturity.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s time to bring this analog law into the digital world, which is not just about phone calls, but where I am and what websites I&rsquo;ve visited.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has any telco ever outright rejected a request?<br><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of them outright rejected a request. Their reasoning was that people are required to use the form that the commissioner&rsquo;s offices uses in order to obtain information about their data. The interesting thing is that the law does indeed say that telcos can choose not to comply with the request is if it&rsquo;s not using the official form. But the privacy commissioner is also on the record saying that if you refuse to comply just because it&rsquo;s not through the form, than that&rsquo;s just a technical argument.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which one was it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PCCW.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What makes advocating for privacy different in Hong Kong than elsewhere?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s different about Hong Kong, or why I wanted to do it in Hong Kong specifically, is because of the social context Hong Kong is in right now. You could argue that Hong Kong people more sensitive towards privacy these days thanks to two incidents in its recent history.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, six years ago, we had the so-called &ldquo;Octopus Incident.&rdquo; This is a case where the smart card we use to pay for everything from public transportation to bills to candy&mdash;it turned out that the company was selling data to other companies, including survey companies and insurance companies.<\/p>\n<p>There was good money&mdash;the money they were making was about a third of their annual revenue. This caused a big controversy and it&rsquo;s why the personal privacy data ordinance was amended in 2012. It&rsquo;s still fairly fresh in people&rsquo;s memories here.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to that, people started worrying about the security of their personal data during the Umbrella Movement. The Umbrella Movement was running on Facebook and WhatsApp and WhatsApp back then wasn&rsquo;t encrypted. There was sensitivity around this data.People were wondering if they were at risk and what the risk might be. So this seemed like a good moment to roll this out project out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You mention the Umbrella Movement, which is undeniably driven by fears about Beijing&rsquo;s increasing influence in Hong Kong. Are you worried about this influence and its effect on privacy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I see Beijing politics and privacy in Hong Kong as two separate issues. We have a separate system of law here, as is well known.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, one thing I am concerned about is maintaining a good legal protection system in Hong Kong. Just because we have a right to privacy or other right now doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll have them forever.<\/p>\n<p>The rights we have are like muscles, if we don&rsquo;t use them they will atrophy. We need to use it and exercise it in order to become strong and healthy.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":678938,"alt":"","title":"A localist protester faces a policeman during an anti-China protest at Mongkok

It warned that if the state didn&#8217;t stop enforcing the law by Monday (May 9), it would face a federal lawsuit.<\/p>\n<p>Today, May 9, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory pre-emptively sued the federal government for &#8220;baseless and blatant overreach.&#8221; He claims the state&#8217;s gender-based bathroom rule is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.patmccrory.com\/2016\/04\/21\/mccrory-campaign-responds-donald-trumps-remarks-ncs-common-sense-privacy-law\/\">&#8220;common sense law.&#8221;<\/a> This afternoon, the federal government responded by following up on its threat, and filed a civil rights suit in a federal court in North Carolina.

Lynch added that the government reserved the right to cut federal funding to the state.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms.

But now, some of the biggest players in the sector seem to be coming apart at the seams.<\/p>\n<p>HSBC cut the valuation of restaurant discovery portal Zomato to $500 million, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Companies\/kYMbixHmp4BiDBdHtSifQL\/Info-Edge-HSBC-disagree-over-Zomato-valuation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Indian media reported<\/a> on May 9<strong style=\"line-height:1.5;\">. <\/strong><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The company had been valued at <\/span><a style=\"line-height:1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/04\/14\/zomato-50m-maplepos\/\" target=\"_blank\">$1 billion<\/a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> after its eighth round of funding last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/670705\/is-flipkart-turning-into-the-perfect-example-of-what-a-tech-startup-must-not-do\/\">Flipkart&rsquo;s devaluation<\/a> had already sent shockwaves across the startup ecosystem. In March, investor Morgan Stanley trimmed Flipkart&rsquo;s valuation by 27% to $11 billion. A month later, another investor, T Rowe Price, cut the value of its holding in the Indian e-commerce firm by 15%.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>The Indian startup community must brace itself for more devaluations in the future, industry experts say. &ldquo;At the time when money was coming into the country, everyone benefited and valuations across sectors shot up. Now, there is a need for correction across the board and I expect more devaluations to happen,&rdquo; Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Delhi-headquartered Greyhound Research, said.<\/p>\n<p>So what happens after a startup&rsquo;s valuation is lowered?<\/p>\n<p>The direct impact is on the startup itself, which may be forced to go for a down round, where investors purchase stocks at a lower valuation. There are other consequences as well.<\/p>\n<h2>We all fall down<\/h2>\n<p>Devaluation can have a significant impact on competitors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>Following the valuation markdown, Flipkart is obviously <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Companies\/TmJdiG503Lhn7AfzEJI8YM\/Have-Flipkart-Snapdeal-hit-a-valuation-wall.html\" target=\"_blank\">struggling to raise funds<\/a> at its preferred valuation. The development has dragged down competitor Snapdeal, too. According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Companies\/TmJdiG503Lhn7AfzEJI8YM\/Have-Flipkart-Snapdeal-hit-a-valuation-wall.html\" target=\"_blank\">report in Mint newspaper<\/a>, Snapdeal has held talks with several new investors who have refused to invest at its current valuation of $6.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a moral impact on the entire category,&rdquo; Gogia said. &ldquo;When a company like Flipkart is devalued, everybody is bound to question the valuation of all other players. The general belief would be that if the market leader is under pressure, others are bound to face similar issues too.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<h2>Job loss<\/h2>\n<p>As funding becomes hard to come by, it becomes essential for a startup to cut costs, usually by trimming the workforce.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Zenifits, a US-based HR automation startup&mdash;devalued <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/highly-valued-startup-zenefits-runs-into-turbulence-1447375220\" target=\"_blank\">48% by Fidelity Investments<\/a> in November 2015&mdash;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/briansolomon\/2016\/02\/26\/troubled-unicorn-zenefits-lays-off-17-of-staff\/#503817904f3f\" target=\"_blank\">said earlier this year<\/a> that it would layoff 17% of its workforce.<\/p>\n<p>Funding slump has already led to several rounds of <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/478663\/are-indian-startups-hiring-recklessly\/\" target=\"_blank\">layoffs in Indian <\/a>startups and devaluations may only worsen things.<\/p>\n<h2>Back to the basics<\/h2>\n<p>Even if employees manage to save their jobs, things may not be the same again.<\/p>\n<p>For the last several years, startups have been among the country&rsquo;s top recruiters&mdash;offering <a href=\"http:\/\/her.yourstory.com\/flipkart-maternity-benefits-0701\" target=\"_blank\">massive perks<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/Expect-a-40-50-increment-if-you-are-working-with-a-startup\/articleshow\/47118618.cms\" target=\"_blank\">increments<\/a>. Devaluations may end such practices.<\/p>\n<p>US-based cloud storage startup Dropbox, which saw a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-funds-fidelity-ipo-idUSKCN0WW1EO\" target=\"_blank\">20% devaluation<\/a> in March, is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/cost-cutting-at-dropbox-and-silicon-valley-startups-2016-5?op=1\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly scaling back<\/a> some fringe benefits of employees. The company will manage to save <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/cost-cutting-at-dropbox-and-silicon-valley-startups-2016-5?op=1\" target=\"_blank\">$38 million per year<\/a> by doing so.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumer &amp; innovation<\/h2>\n<p>Deep discounting by Indian e-commerce players may soon become a thing of the past. As companies struggle to survive funding crunch, they may not be able to subsidise buyers on their platforms anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, startups may be forced to forego investments into innovation in order to have a clearer road to profitability.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Startup devaluations&hellip;can be a blessing in disguise, in the sense that it makes the company leadership take a close hard look at the current monetisation model, re-evaluate any fragilities and make strategic and tactical adjustments accordingly,&rdquo; Anindya Ghose, director of New York University&rsquo;s Center for Business Analytics said.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679758,"alt":"Unicorn-reveller","title":"A reveller dressed as a unicorn .","caption":"Trouble in unicorn land.","credit":"Reuters\/Kieran

Private parts slashed over 20 times. Stab wounds on the back of her head, on the chest, chin, and cheek. Intestines pulled out by an iron rod thrust into the vagina, chest torn open by stabs.<\/p>\n<p>And it is not 6 pm yet. She lies dead for over two hours before her mom returned after the day&rsquo;s labour.<\/p>\n<p>The mother&rsquo;s blood-curdling cries for help are met with dull thuds&mdash;neighbours&rsquo; doors being shut. The police do not arrive for another two hours. Once in, they take a look at the body using the light from mobile phones, and leave. The crime scene is not cordoned off. No policeman is posted on guard, no higher official informed.<\/p>\n<p>It is noontime next day before the body is taken for post-mortem. The autopsy is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deccanchronicle.com\/nation\/crime\/060516\/kerala-rape-case-controversy-over-who-did-autopsy-on-jisha.html\">allegedly performed<\/a> by a student.

(The victim in the Delhi bus rape case was called &ldquo;Nirbhaya&rdquo; by sections of the Indian media.) Soon, news channels picked it up and social media outrage followed. Once the gravity of the situation was brought out, media coverage turned extensive. More details began tumbling out.<\/p>\n<p>Jisha was a law student, the younger daughter of a single mother. Her sister married away, she lived with her mother in a single-room house&mdash;the family&rsquo;s home for the past 40 years.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>It was reported that she was earlier assaulted physically by the brother-in-law of the panchayat (village council) member of her locality. She complained to the police on April 17, 2014, saying she faced a threat to her life. The police claimed she was only verbally abused and her complaints were rejected as baseless.<\/p>\n<p>Today, there is no trace of the murderer or murderers. The police have destroyed all evidence, according to the media. Classic.<\/p>\n<p>The police officers&rsquo; insensitivity to Jisha&rsquo;s plight or her first complaint should surprise no one. She was a Dalit. The family lived in poverty&mdash;their house had no toilet and they used a pit dug inside the house to answer nature&rsquo;s call. They didn&rsquo;t have enough food.<\/p>\n<p>The mother, though mentally unstable, worked hard to bring up her two daughters. Jisha struggled to earn a degree and practice law. The neighbours weren&rsquo;t even aware that she was a law student.<\/p>\n<p>Awarded a small plot under a government scheme for the homeless, the mother-daughter duo was building a home for itself&mdash;and all by itself. There was no money to hire construction labourers.<\/p>\n<h2>Different eras, same mindsets<\/h2>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time a sexual crime in Kerala has shocked the country.<strong> <\/strong>In my early years as a journalist, Kerala&rsquo;s first ever trafficking case came to light. The victim, now known as the &ldquo;Suryanelli girl&rdquo;, was a 16-year-old from Suryanelli, Idukki district.<\/p>\n<p>She was trapped by a bus conductor and made part of a sex racket. Sold to 41 men in 40 days, she and her family have harassment faced ever since.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a marked difference in public attitudes to the Suryanelli and Jisha cases.<\/p>\n<p>A total lack of middle-class sympathy for the Suryanelli victim was evident from the beginning. Even the courts asked why she didn&rsquo;t try to escape. Mainstream media and the honourable high court ridiculed her, calling her deviant. A retired judge termed her a &ldquo;child prostitute&rdquo;&mdash;illegal by the sheer coinageof the term.<\/p>\n<p>There is sympathy for Jisha, though, because she was attacked in broad daylight inside her own home. She was not travelling alone. She didn&rsquo;t wear revealing clothes.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, two decades later, most other things remain the same.<\/p>\n<p>In the history of the rape cases in Kerala, rarely have the police, judiciary, and media shown compassion for the victims or their families.<\/p>\n<p>One the day the Suryanelli girl went missing&mdash;January 16, 1996&mdash;her father frantically sought help. Police officials shooed him away saying they had to look for an old jeep that had gone missing on the same day. So the child was not rescued&mdash;at least not before she was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newindianexpress.com\/states\/kerala\/Suryanelli-victim-was-raped-67-times-in-40-days\/2013\/08\/30\/article1758840.ece\" target=\"_blank\">raped 67 times<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When the culprits did let her go, the police advised her father to withdraw the complaint. He refused. The police turned hostile.<\/p>\n<p>The child was asked to come to the police station to record her statement. Physically and psychologically ravaged, she, along with her father, was kept waiting the entire day even as voyeuristic crowds gathered to take a peek at her. This was repeated over days. The policemen seemed to derive pleasure from the onlookers&rsquo; lewd comments.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><span>Why is it that most men in our police force turn so anti-woman, anti-Dalit, and anti-poor?<\/span><span class=\"quote-line\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>In Jisha&rsquo;s case, the police have been slammed for trying a cover up, especially in view of the May 16 state legislative election. No report was filed with the district collector as is mandatory in the event of the death of a Dalit. The haste with which the body was cremated, leaving no scope for a fresh post-mortem, remains unexplained.<\/p>\n<p>Even after 20 years, which saw open discussions on gender justice and women&rsquo;s rights, misogyny remains deeply embedded in the police.<\/p>\n<p>Why is it that, except for a handful of committed officers, most men in our police force turn so anti-woman, anti-Dalit, and anti-poor? Are they trained this way or do they choose this attitude?<\/p>\n<p>Politicians are no different. They often exhibit savage enthusiasm to turn such cases to their advantage, tarnishing their opponents, who in turn attacked the victims and their families.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, when the Suryanelli victim identified a senior Congress leader&mdash;then a minister in the union cabinet&mdash;as one of her abusers, she was turned into a political tool to attack the Congress party. So, when the Congress-led government returned to power in Kerala, she was framed in a case involving theft at her workplace and jailed.<\/p>\n<p>In Jisha&rsquo;s case, too, politicians are busy shedding ritualistic tears. Promises of secure housing and job for her sister have begun pouring in. The Left-led opposition attacked the Congress-led government over police negligence. The Congress-led ruling front attacked the sitting Left front legislator of the area and the Left-controlled panchayat committee for not lending timely help to the family.<\/p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, more than tracing the culprits, mud-slinging is the focus.<\/p>\n<h2>Women unsafe<\/h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, the number of recorded rapes more than doubled in Kerala <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/politics\/kerala-assembly-polls-jisha-udf-women-safety-ldf-law-student-2766934.html\" target=\"_blank\">to 5,918<\/a> over the past five years. Besides, the number of sexual harassment cases, too, have shot up to 20,201 from 13,381 in the same period.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, only 10% or even fewer cases in Kerala see conviction. Denying and delaying justice in epoch-making rape and sexual harassment cases have contributed to the steep increase in such violence&mdash;both within and outside homes. Add to that, the assaults under the pretext of moral policing.<\/p>\n<p>It was only in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/national\/kerala\/at-a-glance-soumya-rape-and-murder-case\/article2618029.ece\" target=\"_blank\">Soumya rape and murder<\/a> case that the police, politicians, media, and the judiciary, along with the general public, stood together for justice. Death sentence was awarded to the accused, Govindachami, a one-armed non-Malayali thought to be a beggar initially and later found be a hardened criminal.<\/p>\n<p>It is a disturbing thought, though, that had Govindachami been a Malayali, the society may not have stood together.<\/p>\n<h2>Is there hope?<\/h2>\n<p>It is comforting that the ideas of gender justice and gender equality are slowly seeping in through social media, thanks to the work done by feminist groups and women&rsquo;s organisations. Let us hope the mindset that sees a rape victim as a subject of mockery and humiliation will change.<\/p>\n<p>Back to Jisha&mdash;was it a planned rape, accentuated by her caste and class? Considering that rape has nothing to do with sex, and is all about power, violence, and misogyny, isn&rsquo;t it horrendous that it is this society that had bred and raised the culprit too? It is scary that he is still out there, free and unknown.<\/p>\n<p>How many such deaths must we witness? What will be left of us to be shocked?<\/p>\n<p><em>K R Meera is a Kerala-based writer.

A new report in Gizmodo alleges that Facebook workers charged with curating the company&#8217;s&hellip;","content":"\n<p>Facebook&rsquo;s influential trending news feed is looking less and less organic.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006?rev=1462799465508\">new report<\/a> in Gizmodo alleges that Facebook workers charged with curating the company&rsquo;s trending news topics &ldquo;routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers.&rdquo; Facebook buried stories that trended organically among users on Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and the Conservative Political Action Conference, among others, according to Gizmodo&rsquo;s unnamed source, a former journalist who used to work on trending news at Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to suppressing conservative news, Facebook also allegedly boosted topics that managers felt weren&rsquo;t receiving adequate attention from users, a method known at the company as &ldquo;injection.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When users weren&rsquo;t reading stories that management viewed as important, several former workers said, curators were told to put them in the trending news feed anyway. Several former curators described using something called an &ldquo;injection tool&rdquo; to push topics into the trending module that weren&rsquo;t organically being shared or discussed enough to warrant inclusion&mdash;putting the headlines in front of thousands of readers rather than allowing stories to surface on their own. In some cases, after a topic was injected, it actually became the number one trending news topic on Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The report is the latest indication that, contrary to the image it has crafted, Facebook is less a neutral algorithmic arbiter of the news than a media platform with its own liberal-leaning biases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"><\/div><p>Facebook didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Gizmodo reported on the <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/want-to-know-what-facebook-really-thinks-of-journalists-1773916117\">small group of &ldquo;news curators&rdquo;<\/a> Facebook employs to vet and edit its trending topics. That story noted that Facebook&rsquo;s workers were &ldquo;told to select articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included sites like the New York Times, Time, Variety,&rdquo; but would &ldquo;regularly avoid sites like World Star Hip Hop, The Blaze, and Breitbart.&rdquo; It followed a report from April that Facebook employees had asked chief executive Mark Zuckerberg whether they should <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/facebook-employees-asked-mark-zuckerberg-if-they-should-1771012990\">try to stop a Donald Trump presidency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has worked hard to cultivate the impression that its trending queue is mostly algorithmic. On the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/737806312958641\">help section of its website<\/a>, Facebook explains that &ldquo;[t]rending shows you topics that have recently become popular on Facebook &hellip; based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, Pages you&rsquo;ve liked and your location.&rdquo; An article <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recode.net\/2015\/8\/21\/11617880\/how-facebook-decides-whats-trending\">published by Re\/code<\/a> last summer noted that while &ldquo;an actual human being&rdquo; approves trending topics and writes their brief descriptions, those people &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get to pick what Facebook adds to the trending section. That&rsquo;s done automatically by the algorithm.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The implications of Facebook&rsquo;s pseudo-journalistic practices are profound. Facebook is far and away the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/18\/facebook-google\/\">no. 1 source of readers<\/a> for news outlets. On mobile in particular, referrals on Facebook drive an <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/676677\/facebook-drives-more-traffic-to-articles-but-twitter-users-spend-more-time-reading-them\/\">outsized amount of traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"atlas-chart\" data-id=\"BJ8cZ7_b\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"449\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.theatlas.com\/i\/atlas_BJ8cZ7_b.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><\/div>\n<p>The combination of Facebook&rsquo;s vast reach&mdash;more than 1 billion people use it each day&mdash;and its insistence that trending topics are organic can make its news items seem to be legitimate reflections of what people want to read. We accept that the stories in traditional news publications are arranged and edited, but the topics that trend on Facebook are supposed to somehow be a reflection of our collective consciousness.<\/p>\n<p>If trending topics include Black Lives Matter, or the Syrian refugee crisis, or SpaceX&rsquo;s rocket landing, it&rsquo;s supposed to be because some critical mass of the Facebook community cares, not a random group of editors or reporters. If conservative news is conspicuously absent, it&rsquo;s supposed to be because a critical mass of Facebook isn&rsquo;t interested.<\/p>\n<p>That Facebook is pulling the strings shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. But if the company is truly manipulating what people see and regard as &ldquo;trending,&rdquo; Facebook should be honest about that. What we see might not change, but how we think about it will.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":679334,"alt":"","title":"Mark Zuckerberg","caption":"Except maybe conservative news.","credit":"AP Photo\/Eric
