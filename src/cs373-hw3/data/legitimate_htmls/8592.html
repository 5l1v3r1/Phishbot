<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">If you are in Singapore, whether on business or on holiday, we have some great news for you: this jewel of an island hosts many of the world's most luxurious hotels. Regardless of your budget, you can easily find accommodation that will be infused with typical Singaporean good taste and hospitality. Here are three of our favourites.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>The Forest by Wangz</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Do you want nothing but the best during your Singapore stay? Then this famous boutique hotel will be the one for you. Ultra sophisticated, chic and cutting edge in its design, The Forest finds its home in the island's most exclusive neighbourhood. The rooms are incredibly plush and luxuriant, while the facilities, which include an infinity pool, a serene rooftop deck and a highly impressive fitness centre, will satisfy even the pickiest of tourists. For the traveller who just wants a moment of solace, The Forest offers a lush, green oasis upon its grounds &ndash; perfect if you need to recharge the batteries during a hectic business trip.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Amoy</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">If you want a truly authentic Singapore experience during your visit, then Amoy should be your top choice. Located in Far East Square, it draws its inspiration from that area's tradition of shophouses that dates back nearly two centuries. This is where tradition and modernity collide, showing off  much of the best of what the island has to offer. That, along with friendly staff, a free pickup service, great food and a central location all make this a standout hotel.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>The Ritz Carlton Millenia</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Few hotels offer the stunning view available from the best rooms in the Ritz Carlton. From its incredible location on Raffles Avenue, guests can see right across the bay, making it both a luxurious and romantic place to stay. Yet there is plenty of other things to recommend this swanky palace: one of the best breakfast buffets in the city, gorgeous design, a very relaxing spa and lots of activities for children are also on offer when you stay at the Ritz Carlton.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Four Seasons</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">A superb five star hotel located conveniently on Orchard Boulevard, the Four Seasons gives every visitor more than their money's worth. Very plush and very tasteful, it oozes comfort and class at all times. The startling d&eacute;cor mixes the very best traditional Singaporean art and design with cutting edge modern concepts. The One Ninety restaurant is well worth a visit, while the award winning spa offers the tired traveller a whole world of relaxation and pampering.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="227" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/Mandarin-Oriental.jpg" class="blogimg" style="float:left" alt="" />Mandarin Oriental</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">An immaculately designed, beautifully presented little gem, located on plush Raffles Avenue, the Mandarin offers true serenity and peace for the tourist who just wants to get away from it all. Typically, its rooms offer guests a soaring view of the cityscape, where greenery and cutting edge architecture work together in aesthetic harmony. The interiors are very comfortable too. Three eateries are available in-house: the superb Italian restaurant Dolce Vita, the excellent Cantonese place Cherry Garden and the Melt World Caf&eacute;. All of that, along with Spa Suites and a huge fitness centre, means the Mandarin hotel offers visitors a package that is hard to match.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">If you're a sports nut and planning to head to Singapore for either short or long term stay, you'll probably want to know what kind of physical activities the locals like to do. You'll be happy to hear that the Singaporeans love sport and keeping fit, so you have a real plethora of things to choose from. Whether you want to spectate or participate, there's plenty to keep the sports fan entertained. Here are some of the most popular outdoor pursuits and games on the island.</div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Golf</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">If you are one of those people who thinks no sunny day is complete unless it's been spent driving balls down the fairway, then Singapore has lots to offer. Over 20 spectacular courses dot the island, and both members and non-members can be accommodated at most. Amongst the most beautiful places to play golf are the Seletar Base club, which was designed by famous architect Christ Pitman, the Laguna National Golf Club, which has won numerous awards and the Sentosa Club, which is one of the most visited in Asia.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Basketball</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Since the mid-1920s Singapore has been basketball mad. The national team has competed at 16 Asia Championships, while winning bronze in two Southeast Asian Championships. Though not quite as popular as it was in its 70s and 80s heyday, when the team was one of the continent's best, the game is still played regularly all over the island.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Bodybuilding</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">As the population is very interested in clean living and physical fitness, it is unsurprising to learn that bodybuilding is amongst Singapore's most popular sports. The country has produced numerous world and Asian champions, most famously Joan Liew, who has NPC Tournament of Champions, Multi Asian Championships and Asian Women's Bodybuilding Championship titles under her belt and is still competing at the top level today. Other notable Singaporean bodybuilders include Abdul Halim bin Haron, Simon Chua and Azman bin Abdullah.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong><img width="380" vspace="5" align="left" hspace="5" height="285" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/football-in-asia.jpg" class="blogimg" style="float:left" alt="" />Football</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph9" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Though they might not be world beaters, the Singaporeans love football and their national side has punched well above its weight considering the, relatively, small population, frequently coming home winners from the ASEAN Football Championships, where they compete against sides such as Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. If you fancy checking out a football game while you're in Singapore, the place to be is the Singapore Sports Hub, which was opened in 2010.</div>
<div id="paragraph10" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Cricket</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph11" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Like many Asian countries, Singapore take cricket very seriously. The national side has appeared at every International Cricket Council World Cup Qualifier between 1986 and 2005 and, though one of the smaller teams on the world stage, is steadily climbing up the rankings. Since winning the World Cricket League Division Six title back in 2009 they have risen all the way to Division Three, where they finished in 3rd place last year.</div>
<div id="paragraph12" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Swimming</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph13" class="paragraph2">Given its fine batch of glistening beaches and gorgeous climate, it is no surprise that Singapore is a country that loves its watersports. With so many people spending so much of their time in the ocean, it has produced a number of world class swimmers through the years, including Ang Peng Siong, Joscelin Yeo and Tao li.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">There are good and bad points about last minute holidays to Singapore. Many people like to have their vacations planned well in advance, giving them a chance to organize accommodation, transport and the finance required. It is also useful to have the opportunity to plan the holiday itinerary &ndash; particularly when visiting somewhere like Singapore where there is just so much sightseeing to cram into a short space of time.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwin11/3185766627/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/changi-airport-singapore-holidays.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">On the other hand, there is much to be said about traveling at short notice. When you are placed in the position of making last minute travel arrangements, then you can make all sorts of savings to your budget.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">When looking for the best deals the optimum place to start is online. There are many websites which offer superb deals to the Far East. Singapore Airlines, the world's most awarded airline, operate a fleet of modern aircraft. These are on hand for anyone looking to book visits to Singapore at short notice. Because Singapore's airport, Changi, is now Asia's leading hub, there will be many opportunities to book yourself aboard cheap flights to this location, particularly when flight organisers find they have spare seats left to fill.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">The best place to get up-to-the-minute information is online, but a typical deal between May and November, for a Singapore Airlines flight from London Heathrow to Changi, will come in at between &pound;800 and &pound;900.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Looking for cut-price accommodation in Singapore is similarly straightforward. There are ample websites, such as Trip Advisor, that will highlight all the most economical places to book into. Within each site there are invariably reviews of the hotels written by previous customers. These are always an excellent indicator of the various merits of each hotel, as they are written entirely subjectively.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Hotels are always looking to fill their rooms, so keep an eye out for last minute bargains. Of course, a lot depends on exactly why you are visiting Singapore. If you are arriving on a business trip, then luxurious hotel accommodation is not usually high on your agenda. As long as your room is comfortable and there are contemporary facilities &ndash; such as WiFi access &ndash; then your stay will be perfectly accommodated. Similarly, if you intend doing a lot of sightseeing, then all you will be looking for is a home base &ndash; somewhere to recharge your batteries after a long day taking in the numerous visitor attractions.</div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph2">Singapore has a longstanding history of welcoming visitors. So even if your last-minute deal is placing you in less than five-star surroundings, you can be assured your stay will still be extremely pleasant.</div>

                                            <p>On 5th  March 2016, a group of volunteers will be contributing their vocal  talents at Raffles Institution's Performing Arts Centre to raise funds  for a local charity called Daughters Of Tomorrow (DOT), whose founder is  an alumni of the Raffles network of educational institutions in  Singapore. The charity's name itself was inspired by Raffles Girls'  School's motto &ldquo;Filiae Melioris Aevi&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Daughters Of A Better  Age&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This  young upstart charity was set up in 2014 to enable underprivileged  women from low-income families with confidence, skills and access to job  opportunities.  They have built a support network for more than 280  women, impacted more than 40 families and helped 17 women achieve  sustained employment in the short time since they started. Carrie Tan,  the founder was thanked personally for the work being done at DOT by  President Obama himself last November, when she did the opening  introduction for POTUS at a Young Southeast Asian Leaders' Town Hall  session in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Songbirds,  the concert is testament to the dedication of love amongst the DOT   community in Singapore that has made its work possible - people putting  their talents, skills and resources together to enable and empower the  women of Daughters Of Tomorrow. You can read about the volunteer  performers here: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.DaughtersOfTomorrow.org/events">www.DaughtersOfTomorrow.org/events</a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The  event targets to raise $25,000 to support 70 women on their  back-to-work journey. For a $100 ticket, you will not only be helping to  make confidence and a brighter future possible for the women and their  families, you will also be bringing a song into the hearts of the  volunteers who have worked hard for several months to make this event  possible.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">The  concert will be on 5th March 2016 (Saturday 3pm to 6pm), at Raffles  Institution Performing Arts Centre. To purchase tickets, please email  Mel@DaughtersOfTomorrow.org</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">If you are new to traveling to the Far East, there may be certain things you would like to find out about Singapore's climate. Singapore lies in a tropical zone, meaning that you can expect to experience heat and humidity throughout the year. The minimum average temperature is 23&deg;Celsius, and the maximum is around 31&deg;. The readings for humidity range between 70 and 80%.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jk_too/3338131468/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/climate-of-singapore.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">The climate is mostly dry with occasional showers, although you can expect monsoons, the season for which lasts from November through to January. As far as Asian weather is concerned, Singapore's climate is relatively favourable. Many visitors, especially those from colder countries in Northern Europe, are drawn here because of the pleasant heat. The soothing combination of warmth and moisture is ideal for those out and about exploring the attractions the city state has to offer.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Basically, Singapore has the same overall climate as the tropical rainforests in this part of the world. Average daily temperatures do not tend to fluctuate very much, with the region's proximity to the equator meaning heat and humidity remain constant throughout the year. A further part of the equation is the fact that Singapore is an island lying in the South China Sea. This means that cool sea breezes frequently waft inwards, making for a refreshing counterbalance to the heat during the long summer days.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">In order to cope with these climate conditions, the ideal fashion decisions for any tourist should include light clothes, with a portable umbrella in case of sudden downpours. During the monsoon season, there maybe three to four days of continuous rainfall. Even as the season begins to peter out towards April, there is still an increased likelihood of tropical showers. Between June and September you may experience the south-west monsoon, driven by southerly winds. The good news is that because Singapore is so dense populated, you are never far from a doorway to shelter under should you be unlucky enough to be caught in the open during one of these cloudbursts!</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Especially for travelers from the northern hemisphere, it is a good idea to take adequate precautions against the heat. The combination of warmth and moisture can prove deceptive, with travelers not appreciating how much exposure they have had to direct sunshine until they get back to their hotel and feel sunburned. So a good idea is to have a supply of lotions, moisturizers, sun-blocks and other skin creams.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph6">There is no particular time of year that is more advisable than others for visiting Singapore. Its pleasant climate is ideal for those wishing to experience the heat the Far East offers, tempered with moisture and occasional showers.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">One of the most popular pastimes for visitors to Singapore, combining sightseeing with traveling, is to &lsquo;island-hop'. Singapore itself is surrounded by dozens of idyllic island retreats, each one having its own unique characteristics.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/krishnacolor/4814633713/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/kusu-island-singapore.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Kusu</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">An ideal way to escape the hustle and bustle of the metropolis is to head for one of the more tranquil locations, Kusu. Also known colloquially as &lsquo;Tortoise Island', this family-friendly destination is highly recommended for those with an interest in nature, wildlife or history. The island is also the location of the annual Kusu Pilgrimage, between September and November, when thousands of people arrive to pay homage for good luck health and happiness. There is a beautiful lagoon, sandy beaches and a variety of animal life. While the island itself is open to visitors on a daily basis, overnight stays are not allowed.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Sentosa</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">In contrast to the quiet retreat that is Kusu Island, the much larger Sentosa is known as Singapore's playground. Here there are activities to keep you occupied, no matter what your tastes are. You can find out all about insect life at the colourful Butterfly Park and Insect Kingdom, as well as learning out all about flora and fauna on guided tours of Sentosa Nature Discovery. Lovers of white-knuckle rollercoaster entertainment can take a ride on Skyline Luge Sentosa &ndash; a go-kart / toboggan ride that sends you careering downhill on a 650-metre jungle trail.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">For those of a sportier disposition, you can play volleyball on Siloso Beach. When the sun sinks over the horizon, you can be transfixed by &lsquo;Songs of the Sea', a multisensory experience.</div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">During your visit to Sentosa you can check into a five-star hotel, relax in a spa, and if you fancy a break from thrill rides there are heritage sites to explore.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Sister's Islands</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph9" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Sister's Islands lie south of the main island of Singapore. This region is extremely popular with campers and snorkelers, the latter gravitating towards the rich marine life off-shore. A narrow channel separates the islands, and the area is popular for picnics due to the shady palm trees and shelters on the golden beaches. The reefs are home to myriad species of fantastically-colourful tropical fish. Access is gained by chartering a boat from the Marine South Pier - one thing to note is that you require a permit to camp out here.</div>
<div id="paragraph10" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>St. John's Island</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph11" class="paragraph2">St John's Island is a beautiful retreat, close to the thriving streets of Singapore, yet a world away. In days long gone by, this island was a quarantine area for unfortunate leprosy cases as well as a penal colony! Today, thankfully, you are far more likely to be able to observe dolphins frolicking in the surf while you picnic, rather than anything more sinister!</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">While making the transition from being a student to being a fully-fledged professional is an incredibly exciting time in somebody's life, it can also be a nerve-wracking one. If, however, you prepare correctly for the move, there is nothing to worry about. Here are a few tips to start your professional life on the right foot.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Prepare for a lot more diversity </strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">In university or college, you were most probably surrounded by people who were around your age group and, quite possibly, from very similar backgrounds as yourself. In the workplace, things will not be so uniform.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">You are likely to be working at close quarters with people of all sorts of age groups and from all sorts of backgrounds, many of whom will have life experiences and resultant opinions on the world that you had never considered. For anybody who leaves third level education thinking they know it all, the sudden introduction to worldviews that are very distant from their own can be one of the most alarming and unexpected challenges.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5"><strong>Optimise your professional skills</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">While University is often focussed on the achievements and success of the individual, working environments are more often focussed upon the performance of the team. In order to succeed in such an environment, it is crucial you develop strong business skills.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">This is not about getting everybody to see things your way. It is about being sensitive to other people's views on the project at hand. Listen to and learn from the people with more experience than you. Don't be shy about adding your own opinion to the mix, but think hard about it before you do.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph">Singaporefriendly suggest <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.gradgreenhouse.com/graduate/register/?utm_source=pw&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=pw">Singapore University and Colleges Graduates looking for Jobs signup on GradGreenhouse.com</a>, a dedicated recruitment site for graduates based in Singapore, combining the latest technology with state of the art tools, including Video Interviewing.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Get ready for hard work</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">While beavering away at a degree and putting in long hours in the library, many students think that nobody in the world could possibly be dealing with an assignment the size of theirs or putting such a crazy amount of hours into their work. What they don't realise is that, in the real world, people spend 7 &ndash; 9 hours, 5 days a week, working their fingers to the bone in the pursuit of their careers.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">The workload does not reduce when you complete your degree and enter the workforce: it either stays the same or enlarges, and you don't get to take a few hours off to watch a box set when you feel burned out. Get ready to push your stamina level to the maximum.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">Make sure you get the best possible start to your professional life. Keep in mind these key tips and prepare yourself properly for your career path.&nbsp;</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">There is so much to see and do in Singapore that trying to cram it all into a short period of time can be quite tricky. However, this bustling city state on the southern tip of the Asian continent remains the destination of choice for many travelers looking for a weekend break.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/khalzuri/4059088779/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/chinatown-weekend-breaks-singapore.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Distilling all your possibilities into two or three days might seem as if you are letting yourself in for some overly frantic activity. But with careful planning, it is perfectly feasible to prepare an itinerary for a short spell in Singapore.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">A good idea is to jump in at the deep end. Where possible, try to book a hotel that is near the centre of the city. Once you have checked in, exiting your hotel will launch you straight into the hustle and bustle of Singapore life. Head for Chinatown, where you have the opportunity to browse through dozens of interesting shops in a short distance. This is the perfect place to stop for lunch at one of the many chicken rice stalls (known locally as Tian Tian). If you are looking to savour Asian cuisine of a more substantial nature than fast-food, there are also some fabulous restaurants here. Especially recommended are the restaurants at Ann Siang Road and Bukit Pasoh. The good thing about Singapore banquets is that many of the rice and noodle-based dishes will not bag you up, enabling you to carry on with your activities without feeling too bloated.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">To get the most out of your Singapore weekend break, the ideal time to be setting your alarm clock should be around seven or eight o'clock in the morning. Why not head out to Singapore Botanic Gardens where you can watch locals doing their daily exercises before taking breakfast at Casa Verde? Orchard Road is only a few bus stops away. where are you can indulge in some serious retail therapy. Within the many shopping malls there are also numerous places to eat, such as Crystal Jade or Din Tai Fung. These chains offer customers delicious noodles, dim sum and sundry other mouthwatering snacks. If you want to soak up some local culture, the Peranakan Museum is just round the corner. With an annual visitor tally of over 100,000 people, there are 10 galleries showcasing Peranakan culture (all about the descendants of 16th century Chinese immigrants).</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph2">For your final day you could go out with a bang, experiencing the riotous delights of  Universal Studios and the Marine Life Park, one of the world's largest aquariums. With the latter, whether you decide to simply observe the marine creatures, or go swimming with dolphins, the experience will linger with you long after you've left Singapore.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Singapore may be thought of in many people's minds as a thriving metropolis, and location of one of the globe's key financial hubs, nevertheless there is far more to this Asian jewel. Its beaches are particularly impressive, well known to Singaporeans, and growing to be ever more appreciated by an increasing numbers of foreign visitors.<a target='_blank' href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kodomut/3615159377/sizes/z/" target="_blank"><img width="380" vspace="5" hspace="5" height="285" align="left" src="/config/singaporefriendly.com/upload/userfiles/best-beaches-sembawang-beach-singapore.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Sembawang Beach</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Sembawang, a tranquil beach and park, stands on land once occupied by the British army. Indeed, the former colonial residence of Admiral Beaulieu stood here, at Sembawang Jetty, an austere building which has been lovingly restored. Thankfully, there is little evidence of its martial past, as locals congregate here to take advantage of its excellent leisure opportunities &ndash; for swimming, bathing, jogging, or simply relaxing and enjoying the restful ambience.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Senotosa Palawan</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">This beach is particularly popular as a weekend getaway spot. After a long week's toil in Singapore's commercial, financial and retail outlets, workers love making the short journey out to Senotosa Palawan to chill out. It is easily accessible, either by taking the Yellow Line bus to Dolphin Lagoon, next to the beach, hopping on the train from Tanjong Beach, or choosing from the Blue or Green Line buses to Siloso Beach then swapping to the Red Line.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">This sandy beach offers superb walking opportunities, and is especially popular with dog walkers while enjoying the sunsets. The beach incudes a suspension boardwalk that will allow you to stroll to the southernmost point of the Asian continent. Surrounded by tall coconut trees and lush, fragrant shrubs, you'll find many perfect vantage points to relish the view over the South China Sea.</div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">The beach also hosts two renowned bars &ndash; Bora Bora and Club Islander (Singapore's first ever beach club). The atmosphere is second to none, and as well as the stunning landscapes you can listen to jazz musicians while sampling Singapore Slings and other fabulous cocktails.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Sentosa Tanjong</strong></div>
<div id="paragraph9" class="paragraph2">Tanjong is often referred to as Singapore's finest. The waters are clear, the extensive sands uniformly golden, and the landscape is shrouded with nodding palm trees. While the beach is particularly peaceful during the daytime, things get a whole lot hotter after the sun has set. Many Ibiza and 'Zouk Out' parties have been hosted here over the years. The beach bar km8 resonates to pulsating dance rhythms as a succession of DJ's spin the discs, frequently augmented by percussive grooves on steel drums or bongos. What else? This beach bar boasts a 7.3 x 3.6 metre Jacuzzi on a raised wooden deck &ndash; you can't get a more temperature-rising attraction in any club than that!</div>
