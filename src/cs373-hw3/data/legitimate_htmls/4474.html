Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. <b>Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.</b> Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.</p><p class=bold><a href="javascript:void(0);" id="what_is_bitcoin_signup_page_read_more_link">READ MORE...</a></p><div class ="row"><div class="large-12 small-12 large-centered small-centered columns" style="text-align:center;"><iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Gc2en3nHxA4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><div class="row" style="padding-top:10px;"> <div class="large-12 large-centered columns show-for-large-up text-center"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- FreeBitcoin-Top-Big-Leader --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:970px;height:90px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5868756839513168" data-ad-slot="9416483168"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({params: { google_ad_channel: '7719045968'}});</script></div></div></div></div><div id="what_is_bitcoin_signup_page_more"><p class="faq_question bold">Why should you use Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost.</p><p class="bold">Mobile payments made easy</p><p>Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. And all you need to do to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).</p><p class="bold">Security and control over your money</p><p>Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to protect your wallet, Bitcoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud.</p><p class="bold">Works everywhere, anytime</p><p>Just like with email, you don't need to force your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!</p><p class="bold">Fast international payments</p><p>Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes. There is no bank to slow down the process, level outrageous fees, or freeze the transfer. You can pay your neighbors the same way as you can pay a member of your family in another country.</p><p class="bold">Zero or low fees</p><p>Bitcoin allows you to send and receive payments at very low cost. Except for special cases like very small payments, there is no enforced fee. It is however recommended to pay a higher voluntary fee for faster confirmation of your transaction and to remunerate the people who operate the Bitcoin network.</p><p class="bold">Protect your identity</p><p>With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with real money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How does Bitcoin work?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the "block chain". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called "mining". To learn more about Bitcoin, you can consult the dedicated page and the original paper.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Who created Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called "cryptocurrency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.</p><p>Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Who controls the Bitcoin network?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin really used by people?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Yes. There is a growing number of businesses and individuals using Bitcoin. This includes brick and mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, law firms, and popular online services such as Namecheap, WordPress, and Reddit. While Bitcoin remains a relatively new phenomenon, it is growing fast. At the end of August 2013, the value of all bitcoins in circulation exceeded US$ 1.5 billion with millions of dollars worth of bitcoins exchanged daily.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How does one acquire bitcoins?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p><ul style="padding-left:20px;"><li>As payment for goods or services.</li><li>Purchase bitcoins at a Bitcoin exchange.</li><li>Exchange bitcoins with someone near you.</li><li>Earn bitcoins through competitive mining.</li></ul></p><p>While it may be possible to find individuals who wish to sell bitcoins in exchange for a credit card or PayPal payment, most exchanges do not allow funding via these payment methods. This is due to cases where someone buys bitcoins with PayPal, and then reverses their half of the transaction. This is commonly referred to as a chargeback.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How difficult is it to make a Bitcoin payment?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together with NFC technology.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p><ul style="padding-left:20px;"><li>Payment freedom - It is possible to send and receive any amount of money instantly anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No imposed limits. Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.</li><li>Very low fees - Bitcoin payments are currently processed with either no fees or extremely small fees. Users may include fees with transactions to receive priority processing, which results in faster confirmation of transactions by the network. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts daily. As these services are based on Bitcoin, they can be offered for much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card networks.</li><li>Fewer risks for merchants - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.</li><li>Security and control - Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Bitcoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Bitcoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption.</li><li>Transparent and neutral - All information concerning the Bitcoin money supply itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.</li></ul></p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p><ul style="padding-left:20px;"><li>Degree of acceptance - Many people are still unaware of Bitcoin. Every day, more businesses accept bitcoins because they want the advantages of doing so, but the list remains small and still needs to grow in order to benefit from network effects.</li><li>Volatility - The total value of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small events, trades, or business activities can significantly affect the price. In theory, this volatility will decrease as Bitcoin markets and the technology matures. Never before has the world seen a start-up currency, so it is truly difficult (and exciting) to imagine how it will play out.</li><li>Ongoing development - Bitcoin software is still in beta with many incomplete features in active development. New tools, features, and services are being developed to make Bitcoin more secure and accessible to the masses. Some of these are still not ready for everyone. Most Bitcoin businesses are new and still offer no insurance. In general, Bitcoin is still in the process of maturing.</li></ul></p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Why do people trust Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin, and the network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Can I make money with Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules.</p><p>Bitcoin is a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to grow even though it has developed at a very fast rate so far. Investing time and resources on anything related to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with Bitcoin such as mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are competitive and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the risks involved in any such project.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin fully virtual and immaterial?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is as virtual as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Bitcoin can be used to pay online and in physical stores just like any other form of money. Bitcoins can also be exchanged in physical form such as the Casascius coins, but paying with a mobile phone usually remains more convenient. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin anonymous?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records. Various mechanisms exist to protect users' privacy, and more are in development. However, there is still work to be done before these features are used correctly by most Bitcoin users.</p><p>Some concerns have been raised that private transactions could be used for illegal purposes with Bitcoin. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems. Bitcoin cannot be more anonymous than cash and it is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. Additionally, Bitcoin is also designed to prevent a large range of financial crimes.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What happens when bitcoins are lost?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost bitcoins still remain in the block chain just like any other bitcoins. However, lost bitcoins remain dormant forever because there is no way for anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available, the ones that are left will be in higher demand and increase in value to compensate.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The Bitcoin network can already process a much higher number of transactions per second than it does today. It is, however, not entirely ready to scale to the level of major credit card networks. Work is underway to lift current limitations, and future requirements are well known. Since inception, every aspect of the Bitcoin network has been in a continuous process of maturation, optimization, and specialization, and it should be expected to remain that way for some years to come. As traffic grows, more Bitcoin users may use lightweight clients, and full network nodes may become a more specialized service. For more details, see the Scalability page on the Wiki.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin legal?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.</p><p>Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin useful for illegal activities?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. Cash, credit cards and current banking systems widely surpass Bitcoin in terms of their use to finance crime. Bitcoin can bring significant innovation in payment systems and the benefits of such innovation are often considered to be far beyond their potential drawbacks.</p><p>Bitcoin is designed to be a huge step forward in making money more secure and could also act as a significant protection against many forms of financial crime. For instance, bitcoins are completely impossible to counterfeit. Users are in full control of their payments and cannot receive unapproved charges such as with credit card fraud. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and immune to fraudulent chargebacks. Bitcoin allows money to be secured against theft and loss using very strong and useful mechanisms such as backups, encryption, and multiple signatures.</p><p>Some concerns have been raised that Bitcoin could be more attractive to criminals because it can be used to make private and irreversible payments. However, these features already exist with cash and wire transfer, which are widely used and well-established. The use of Bitcoin will undoubtedly be subjected to similar regulations that are already in place inside existing financial systems, and Bitcoin is not likely to prevent criminal investigations from being conducted. In general, it is common for important breakthroughs to be perceived as being controversial before their benefits are well understood. The Internet is a good example among many others to illustrate this.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Can Bitcoin be regulated?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The Bitcoin protocol itself cannot be modified without the cooperation of nearly all its users, who choose what software they use. Attempting to assign special rights to a local authority in the rules of the global Bitcoin network is not a practical possibility. Any rich organization could choose to invest in mining hardware to control half of the computing power of the network and become able to block or reverse recent transactions. However, there is no guarantee that they could retain this power since this requires to invest as much than all other miners in the world.</p><p>It is however possible to regulate the use of Bitcoin in a similar way to any other instrument. Just like the dollar, Bitcoin can be used for a wide variety of purposes, some of which can be considered legitimate or not as per each jurisdiction's laws. In this regard, Bitcoin is no different than any other tool or resource and can be subjected to different regulations in each country. Bitcoin use could also be made difficult by restrictive regulations, in which case it is hard to determine what percentage of users would keep using the technology. A government that chooses to ban Bitcoin would prevent domestic businesses and markets from developing, shifting innovation to other countries. The challenge for regulators, as always, is to develop efficient solutions while not impairing the growth of new emerging markets and businesses.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What about Bitcoin and taxes?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is not a fiat currency with legal tender status in any jurisdiction, but often tax liability accrues regardless of the medium used. There is a wide variety of legislation in many different jurisdictions which could cause income, sales, payroll, capital gains, or some other form of tax liability to arise with Bitcoin.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What about Bitcoin and consumer protection?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is freeing people to transact on their own terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way to cash but they can also take part in more complex contracts. Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be accepted by the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the transaction. This allows innovative dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. Such services could allow a third party to approve or reject a transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on their money. As opposed to cash and other payment methods, Bitcoin always leaves a public proof that a transaction did take place, which can potentially be used in a recourse against businesses with fraudulent practices.</p><p>It is also worth noting that while merchants usually depend on their public reputation to remain in business and pay their employees, they don't have access to the same level of information when dealing with new consumers. The way Bitcoin works allows both individuals and businesses to be protected against fraudulent chargebacks while giving the choice to the consumer to ask for more protection when they are not willing to trust a particular merchant.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How are bitcoins created?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>New bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called "mining". This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. Bitcoin miners are processing transactions and securing the network using specialized hardware and are collecting new bitcoins in exchange.</p><p>The Bitcoin protocol is designed in such a way that new bitcoins are created at a fixed rate. This makes Bitcoin mining a very competitive business. When more miners join the network, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a profit and miners must seek efficiency to cut their operating costs. No central authority or developer has any power to control or manipulate the system to increase their profits. Every Bitcoin node in the world will reject anything that does not comply with the rules it expects the system to follow.</p><p>Bitcoins are created at a decreasing and predictable rate. The number of new bitcoins created each year is automatically halved over time until bitcoin issuance halts completely with a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. At this point, Bitcoin miners will probably be supported exclusively by numerous small transaction fees.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Why do bitcoins have value?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoins have value because they are useful as a form of money. Bitcoin has the characteristics of money (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability) based on the properties of mathematics rather than relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like fiat currencies). In short, Bitcoin is backed by mathematics. With these attributes, all that is required for a form of money to hold value is trust and adoption. In the case of Bitcoin, this can be measured by its growing base of users, merchants, and startups. As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What determines bitcoin's price?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Can bitcoins become worthless?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Yes. History is littered with currencies that failed and are no longer used, such as the German Mark during the Weimar Republic and, more recently, the Zimbabwean dollar. Although previous currency failures were typically due to hyperinflation of a kind that Bitcoin makes impossible, there is always potential for technical failures, competing currencies, political issues and so on. As a basic rule of thumb, no currency should be considered absolutely safe from failures or hard times. Bitcoin has proven reliable for years since its inception and there is a lot of potential for Bitcoin to continue to grow. However, no one is in a position to predict what the future will be for Bitcoin.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin a bubble?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>A fast rise in price does not constitute a bubble. An artificial over-valuation that will lead to a sudden downward correction constitutes a bubble. Choices based on individual human action by hundreds of thousands of market participants is the cause for bitcoin's price to fluctuate as the market seeks price discovery. Reasons for changes in sentiment may include a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, a large difference between value and price not based on the fundamentals of the Bitcoin economy, increased press coverage stimulating speculative demand, fear of uncertainty, and old-fashioned irrational exuberance and greed.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Ponzi schemes are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new participants.</p><p>Bitcoin is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollar, euro, yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads to volatility where owners of bitcoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Bitcoin is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Some early adopters have large numbers of bitcoins because they took risks and invested time and resources in an unproven technology that was hardly used by anyone and that was much harder to secure properly. Many early adopters spent large numbers of bitcoins quite a few times before they became valuable or bought only small amounts and didn't make huge gains. There is no guarantee that the price of a bitcoin will increase or drop. This is very similar to investing in an early startup that can either gain value through its usefulness and popularity, or just never break through. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and it has been designed with a very long-term view; it is hard to imagine how it could be less biased towards early adopters, and today's users may or may not be the early adopters of tomorrow.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Won't the finite amount of bitcoins be a limitation?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Bitcoin is unique in that only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. However, this will never be a limitation because transactions can be denominated in smaller sub-units of a bitcoin, such as bits - there are 1,000,000 bits in 1 bitcoin. Bitcoins can be divided up to 8 decimal places (0.000 000 01) and potentially even smaller units if that is ever required in the future as the average transaction size decreases.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Won't Bitcoin fall in a deflationary spiral?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The deflationary spiral theory says that if prices are expected to fall, people will move purchases into the future in order to benefit from the lower prices. That fall in demand will in turn cause merchants to lower their prices to try and stimulate demand, making the problem worse and leading to an economic depression.</p><p>Although this theory is a popular way to justify inflation amongst central bankers, it does not appear to always hold true and is considered controversial amongst economists. Consumer electronics is one example of a market where prices constantly fall but which is not in depression. Similarly, the value of bitcoins has risen over time and yet the size of the Bitcoin economy has also grown dramatically along with it. Because both the value of the currency and the size of its economy started at zero in 2009, Bitcoin is a counterexample to the theory showing that it must sometimes be wrong.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, Bitcoin is not designed to be a deflationary currency. It is more accurate to say Bitcoin is intended to inflate in its early years, and become stable in its later years. The only time the quantity of bitcoins in circulation will drop is if people carelessly lose their wallets by failing to make backups. With a stable monetary base and a stable economy, the value of the currency should remain the same.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Isn't speculation and volatility a problem for Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>This is a chicken and egg situation. For bitcoin's price to stabilize, a large scale economy needs to develop with more businesses and users. For a large scale economy to develop, businesses and users will seek for price stability.</p><p>Fortunately, volatility does not affect the main benefits of Bitcoin as a payment system to transfer money from point A to point B. It is possible for businesses to convert bitcoin payments to their local currency instantly, allowing them to profit from the advantages of Bitcoin without being subjected to price fluctuations. Since Bitcoin offers many useful and unique features and properties, many users choose to use Bitcoin. With such solutions and incentives, it is possible that Bitcoin will mature and develop to a degree where price volatility will become limited.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What if someone bought up all the existing bitcoins?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. Bitcoin markets are competitive, meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Additionally, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. Therefore even the most determined buyer could not buy all the bitcoins in existence. This situation isn't to suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation; it still doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset thus far.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What if someone creates a better digital currency?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>That can happen. For now, Bitcoin remains by far the most popular decentralized virtual currency, but there can be no guarantee that it will retain that position. There is already a set of alternative currencies inspired by Bitcoin. It is however probably correct to assume that significant improvements would be required for a new currency to overtake Bitcoin in terms of established market, even though this remains unpredictable. Bitcoin could also conceivably adopt improvements of a competing currency so long as it doesn't change fundamental parts of the protocol.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What is Bitcoin mining?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as "mining" as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins. Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How does Bitcoin mining work?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created bitcoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula.</p><p>For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with a mathematical proof of work. Such proofs are very hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than by trying billions of calculations per second. This requires miners to perform these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the difficulty of finding valid blocks is automatically increased by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no individual miner can control what is included in the block chain.</p><p>The proof of work is also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this requires the recalculation of the proofs of work of all the subsequent blocks. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners work on the first block they receive and switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power.</p><p>Bitcoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network because all Bitcoin nodes would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured.</p><p>Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware consuming less energy, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn't actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">How does mining help secure Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What do I need to start mining?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>In the early days of Bitcoin, anyone could find a new block using their computer's CPU. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased greatly to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining today is using specialized hardware. You can visit BitcoinMining.com for more information.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin secure?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record, and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ sound security practices to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance against theft or loss.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, security flaws have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity.</p><p>There are often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, none of them involve Bitcoin itself being hacked, nor imply inherent flaws in Bitcoin; just like a bank robbery doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However, it is accurate to say that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions is needed to give users better protection of their money, and to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last few years, such security features have quickly developed, such as wallet encryption, offline wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-signature transactions.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Could users collude against Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>It is not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol that easily. Any Bitcoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Therefore, It is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar.</p><p>However, powerful miners could arbitrarily choose to block or reverse recent transactions. A majority of users can also put pressure for some changes to be adopted. Because Bitcoin only works correctly with a complete consensus between all users, changing the protocol can be very difficult and requires an overwhelming majority of users to adopt the changes in such a way that remaining users have nearly no choice but to follow. As a general rule, it is hard to imagine why any Bitcoin user would choose to adopt any change that could compromise their own money.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">Is Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that quantum computing could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Bitcoin users.</p></div><p class="faq_question bold">What if I have more questions about Bitcoin?</p><div class="faq_answer"><p>Three great places where you can get your questions answered are the BitcoinTalk Forum at <a href="http://bitcointalk.org" target="_blank">BitcoinTalk.org</a>, the Bitcoin sub-reddit at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin" target="_blank">Reddit.com/r/bitcoin</a> and Bitcoin Stack Exchange at <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Bitcoin.StackExchange.com</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><!-- NEWS START --><div style="background-color:#003333;" id="home_news"><div class="row"><div class="large-12 large-centered columns"><div class="row" style="margin-top:30px;"><div class="large-12 small-12 large-centered small-centered columns"><h3 class="center" style="color:white;">LATEST BITCOIN NEWS</h3></div></div><div class="row" style="margin-top:30px;"><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ShowNews(13);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - May 14th 2016</a></h4><div class="large-11 small-12 large-centered columns news_content" style="text-align:left;display:none;" id="news_content_13"><p><h5><u>Craig Wright strikes again</u></h5></p><p>Some Background: Dr. Craig Wright put the time and effort into elaborately scamming Jon Matonis and Gavin Andersen by signing blocks 1 and block 9 with a fake client, this botched client was used on Gavin's machine which alluded both Gavin and Jon to proceed publicly proclaiming that Craig is Satoshi Nakamoto. As we saw how this turns out with mainstream media, there was an echo across the likes of BBC and Forbes. Once the cat was out the bag those two took irreversible positions in their credibility index within the community because there was a slew of criticism afterward on the character and reasoning of the two. We've since heard from Electrum stating on twitter that no copies of their software signatures were downloaded from their apparent location (London) on the night that Gavin verified signatures from blocks 9 from Craig. The issue here is that Craig has the ability to sign the keys from anywhere all he needs to do is sign it himself and share the signature, we all have the ability to verify keys, he doesn't need someone to be flown out across the world just to be scammed (as what has happened to Gavin). Since then the community as been in an uproar with ridicule for Gavin and Craig. This has since led to a public apology from Craig on his website and further ridicule.</p><p><h5><u>Support Zug!</u></h5></p><p>As of July 1st, the Swiss town of Zug will be participating in our great BTC experiment with the provisional support of payment for local services using the cryptocurrency! According to engagement, "...as long as you're shelling out the equivalent of 200 francs ($206 US) or less, you can skip old-fashioned money. The trial will run through the rest of 2016, though whether or not it lives beyond that depends on the town council's findings." This experiment they are running is interesting because we don't have other towns that I am aware of doing such an endeavor, they have a small sized population but at the same time exert a strong spending capacity and they're isolated in terms of influence. The spending behaviors and habits of the citizens somewhat show whether or not there is a public interest making payments with bitcoin if presented as an available option. If you happen to reside in Zug and are reading this then I strongly urge you to show support with your crypto.</p><p><h5><u>Coinkite discloses a leaked Database Incident!</u></h5></p><p>According to a Security notice posted on the Coinkite company blog, while turning off all services and firewalls that a copy of their database 'may have' been inadvertently leaked. They state to not worry as each password is secured with over 100K rounds of sha256 password hash salting, though that does not protect your data from being spammed or sold to would-be identity thieves. Please take extra precautions if you have ever used the Canadian web wallet/Bitcoin exchange.</p><p><h5><u>Ripple and Coinbase about to receive BitLicenses</u></h5></p><p>The New York Department of Financial Services will be issuing two more BitLicences, bringing up the entire number to three issued in total. Ripple and Coinbase will be joining the ranks of Circle in having their own BitLicence - certifying compliance that they are legally entitled to engage in business with citizens in the state of New York. The BitLicence is restrictive legislation designed to help prevent forms of money laundering through enforcement of transparency of all activities regarding cryptocurrency institutions to be disclosed to NYDFS and was drafted by Ben Lawsky in 2014. The backlash of this legislation is that many different cryptocurrency organizations refuse to conduct business with residents of New York. Ripple and Coinbase have registered to ensure compliance with New York and better serve customers within those jurisdictions in lieu of the lack of support from other Cryptocurrency businesses.</p><p><h5><u>Congratulations Colony!</u></h5></p><p>Consensus 2016 is a Bitcoin conference that occurred in New York during the past week. In addition to talks and presentations, there was a proof of work startup showcase where five different companies displayed current projects. Colony came in first and as a result has earned $10,000 towards their efforts. According to their concept, you join the platform to contribute and collaborate with different communities in exchange for your services you gain proceeds; a token dubbed 'nectar'. This nectar is then sold to external parties supposedly. Looking at colony.io it's clear that it currently exists as an interest list with the potential of becoming a fully fledged application to integrate with existing services.</p><p><h5><u>Bitpay launches a Reloadable Visa Debit Card with Bitcoin</u></h5></p><p>To join the Ranks of Circle and Coinbase, now Bitpay has upped the ante with a reloadable debit card of their own! For the low price of $9.95, you can buy your own Bitpay debit card which can be refilled with any bitcoin wallet. I presume that it works one way with the conversion - once you put funds onto the card, that's it. Debit cards are a great addition to the ecosystem because they give a method by which Bitcoin can be easily spent without needing to login each time or requesting that a local business takes your coin.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ShowNews(12);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - May 6th 2016</a></h4><div class="large-11 small-12 large-centered columns news_content" style="text-align:left;display:none;" id="news_content_12"><p><h5><u>Western Union investing in DCG</u></h5></p><p>The Digital Currency Group is a conglomerate strategy and investing partnership consisting of Coindesk (acquired in January 2016), Genesis mining and GrayScale Ventures. Lead by Barry Silbert, who is known for the Bitcoin Investment Trust (a fund that allows anyone to invest their 401k as a Bitcoin Derivative) the DCG was able to establish an undisclosed sum and has established strategic partnerships with larger players interested to take a bite out of fintech space through 'blockchain' derived systems, including "Western Union, Beijing-based HCM International Company and a number of family offices, investment managers and funds including Gibraltar Ventures, OMERS Ventures, Horizon Kinetics, Kingsbridge Wealth Management and Wood Investment Partners". In addition to the investment increase, they will see a favorable bump in manpower as well including the likes of Gavin Andersen and Lawrence Lenihan and Summers, citing concerns for needing manpower and resources to succeed with a viable business model moving forward for DCG.</p><p><h5><u>Mycelium offering a Crowdsale for their upcoming Wallet++(+) Platform</u></h5></p><p>If you do bitcoin mobile payments or have used more than three different bitcoin wallets on android, chances are you have run across Mycelium, one of the best wallets known (with an included local market trader feature to buy and sell bitcoin locally). While they had physical wallets on the horizon in the past it appears that they look to massively upgrade their software offerings first with an entire suite of tools, integrations and software to compete with QuickBooks or Mint but with bitcoin! If interested, you too have the opportunity to invest in this crowd offering on the wallet. The crowdfund is being set up to help pay for scaled costs that would accrue as a result of the massive software changes (which include refactoring the entire codebase into React Native - for both an IOS an Android unified application). Though the value is not guaranteed, the potential to change the way we use bitcoin for accountability through finances is guaranteed to change towards the favour of automation for sure. For more information on the features or the crowd sale offering, visit wallet.mycelium.com.</p><p><h5><u>Its Official!</u></h5></p><p>I've been harping about this for months now and it appears to now be legit!, http://puu.sh/oD3ER/f99b17b3a9.png. Steam now officially takes bitcoin payments for their store! Steam represents 15% of the global PC games sales for 2015 or roughly 3.5 billion dollars. Some of the hottest titles on the platform include DotA, Team Fortress 2 and CounterStrike: Global Offensive, with millions of players gaming at any given time of day globally. The proliferation of Bitcoin payments on Steam affords the ability for more promotion of the cryptocurrency in addition to potential consequential demand through the form of increased desire for bitcoin rebates, peer-fueled tipping for good content and competitions with prizes denominated in Bitcoin. Today it's Steam, in 5 years, it could be VR Drone Combat racing powered with Bitcoin!</p><p><h5><u>Picture of Clinton Holding a Bitcoin circulating on Twitter</u></h5></p><p>Is it authentic or a fake? For now, we'll be left to speculate with the photo, though it's fairly clear that Matt Roszak did give him a Kilara Physical Bitcoin. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChK1JjuWkAE5WlO.jpg. It's always nice to bridge the understanding between casual observer and holder of knowledge. Clearly Bill's face was lit up from either the intricate design of the physical bitcoin itself, the fact that it holds ornate as well as legitimate value privately, or both. Such photos and events give rise to influence with our elders because with these trinkets come a story of how they came into being and how they serve utility, knowing the utility also means better grasping the underlying fundamentals that power systems we seek to better utilize.</p><p><h5><u>Deloitte working on a Facebook Messenger Bitcoin mixin Bot</u></h5></p><p>Deloitte is a Professional Services and Consulting Network that focuses on forward-facing technologies and applications. Over the course of three days, teams from all participated in an internal hackathon where an application was prototyped to use the Facebook messenger API and the Bitcoin Blockchain to facilitate a proof of payment and receipt of a transaction to serve as a public warranty record. Through a QR code dispersed at the receipt level, their app would take that QR code and parse it as a receipt or warranty or even as an insurance on the bitcoin blockchain. Though the solution was essentially a weekend project and remains as a white-label item, the actual scalability and success of such an application remain to be seen.</p><p><h5><u>ChipChap API goes into BETA</u></h5></p><p>ChipChap is an ATM and wallet solutions provider - if you are into Bitcoin and live in Spain or Poland, you have likely heard of them. Apparently they are releasing a developer API into full beta this past week. Using this API will enable developers to create wallet services, take payments through HalCash, Ukash, Paynet and Faircoin with fancy administrative features listed such as servers status, user management and even data analytics. This API joins the likes of Bitpay, Coinbase, Chain.com and Block.io.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ShowNews(11);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - April 27th 2016</a></h4><div class="large-11 small-12 large-centered columns news_content" style="text-align:left;display:none;" id="news_content_11"><p><h5><u>Bitcoin Payments on Steam Platform beginning to seem plausible</u></h5></p><p>We've reported this in the past and again it occurs. Valve, the parent company behind the major gaming service Steam, mentions working actively with a payment processor (hint: Bitpay), to bring bitcoin payments processing directly onto the Steam Platform. This is either exciting news or somewhat disappointing news, depending on your point of view. If you happen to own a store where you sell steam keys or a platform where you allow others to list their steam keys, in-game content, then your market is being absorbed into the Steam platform along with your sales. If you directly sell wares then perhaps that means you get to earn bitcoin in addition to PayPal when reselling items, making the net gain positive for BTC!</p><p><h5><u>BitcoinsInIreland is having a 2016 international Survey</u></h5></p><p>Perhaps you have heard of faucets or signature campaigns to earn bitcoin, well taking surveys on Mechanical Turk is another! Though skip that, now take this survey instead! It's offered in 11 languages and there is 1.25 Bitcoin available to be divvied down to the participants. According to the site, if you "use, mine, trade or have a general interest in bitcoin, plus those who&rsquo;ve never heard of it before!", then consider yourself a potential participant!. English Survey: http://goo.gl/Q6hqiY, main page: http://goo.gl/pZbk6t</p><p><h5><u>Segregated Witness has been finalized into a Pull Request for Bitcoin Core</u></h5></p><p>SW has been a hot topic for a long time during the past year with Bitcoin. For those who aren't familiar with it, the technology is a rework of the Bitcoin protocol, allowing for a greater level of efficiency in the way transactions are made and confirmed, allowing for a greater increase in potential transaction capacity, before taking into account the current 1MB limit on Bitcoin Blocksize. The past few weekly roundups talk of a SegNet, a testnet block explorer to see these blocks in action on the developer testing version of the Bitcoin Blockchain. This Pull request is the software code changes made to the source code and is expected to be merged along with an activation of the new features by means of either a hard or soft fork. Forks simply mean a change in the way the software works and either require everyone to update (in case of hard forks) or for the new software to function without breaking how the old software functions (a soft fork). The list of changes to be done is immense and fun to enjoy should you happen to understand protocol level implementation interfaces: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7910</p><p><h5><u>Bitcoin has been added to the Dictionary</u></h5></p><p>On Wednesday, April 20th the Merriam-Webster Dictionary released a list of a couple thousand new words and phrases to be added into the unabridged expanded version of their dictionary; needless to say Bitcoin made the cut! Short and sweet, bitcoin was defined as "a digital currency created for use in peer-to-peer online transactions". The next logical step at this point would be to include cryptocurrency in there as well to better encompass the ecosystem of available goods and services being offered through the use of cryptocurrency, notable example being bitcoin.</p><p><h5><u>Keza Stock Investment App goes Dark</u></h5></p><p>Keza on the surface was an amazing project. A way for layman users to invest bitcoin into potential stock trading strategies, this project seemed like a means to allow millennial level solutions for access to savings and investment vehicle products. According to their current website and customer support emails, this project is being shut down due to lack of interest. Hopefully, this platform will be simulated through new settlement style platforms, t0.com.</p><p><h5><u>Liberland unveils Cryptocurrency Plan</u></h5></p><p>In tandem to their one-year anniversary of the unveiling of Liberland, the micronation between Serbia and Croatia had announced a cryptocurrency plan to assist in the expansion of the micronation. The Liberlandian Merit (LM), as it's named, will be an upcoming colored coin, pegged to the USD initially at a 1:1 value. The cost of application for citizenship to Liberland will be 10,000 LMs and is expected to bolster funding to help finalize legitimacy for Liberland.</p><p><h5><u>Bitcoin Price Analysis</u></h5></p><p>Bullish is the trend of the week. We've seen a steady climb in the price through dramatic fashion, speculated from the news with Steam, the recent pull request for Segregated Witness and potentially the upcoming halving causing a 'fury with fear of missing out' happening amongst sideline speculators. We've seen a nearly 10% jump this week from 428 to 460 with no signs of retracement in sight. I see Bitcoin remaining bullish and would suggest staying or going long if you can.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ShowNews(10);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - April 21st 2016</a></h4><div class="large-11 small-12 large-centered columns news_content" style="text-align:left;display:none;" id="news_content_10"><p><h5><u>Changetip's future is uncertain as most of the company is picked up by AirBnb</u></h5></p><p>Reports have surfaced that a majority of Changetip's group has been hired as talent for the popular crowdsource room rental solution, AirBnb. Debuting on the scene in 2014, Changetip was known for leaving their mark on Reddit as the premier solution for tipping Bitcoin. To see how busy the service is, simply head to https://reddit.com/user/changetip to see more.</p><p><h5><u>Shapeshift.io hack was likely an inside job by former employee</u></h5></p><p>The plot thickens! In heed to continue to remain transparent, Erik Voorhees has released a public statement regarding the recent hack and theft of hot wallet funds from Shapeshift.io, citing that a former employee abused access rights to assist an external 3rd party to facilitate the breach. Since announcing the statement, Shapeshift was offline for security hardening and audits. Their service has been resumed as of Tuesday, April 19th. Hack debriefing listed Here: https://goo.gl/UbtB0o.</p><p><h5><u>Kraken Gains Series B Investment while expanding Bitcoin and Ethereum services in Japan</u></h5></p><p>The full featured Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken via press release has announced an expansion of services to Japan with an extended investment from Money Partners Group, a leading foreign exchange brokerage. Timing couldn't be better: Kraken has posted unexpected 4x growth in new customer acquisition in comparison to 2015. CEO Jesse Powel quoted during a conference for the press release states: "This investment from Money Partners Group is more validation that our long-game approach to the digital asset exchange business has been the right strategy."</p><p><h5><u>Genesis Mining takes a direct shot at Donald Trump through new Marketing Campaign</u></h5></p><p>A digital billboard was spotted and posted to Reddit from Genesis Mining, poking fun at Donald Trump's rants to build a wall. "Your Wall Won't Stop Bitcoin Mr. Trump!" The billboard is a continuation of the #ExploreBitcoin marketing campaign from Genesis to get Bitcoin in as front of as many new eyes as possible and pairs print, billboard, human signage and vehicle ad placement.</p><p><h5><u>Datt is being rebranded as Yours</u></h5></p><p>Datt, started by Ryan Charles of Reddit fame, is a monetized decentralized social network that runs on top of NodeJs. These days, however, they've rebranded themselves as Yours. Yours.press is essentially the same platform, allowing anyone to tip content they enjoy in a Reddit-like fashion, but with a twist: The ability to receive kickback tips for promoting and sharing other content. If you tip content and many others tip that content after you did, you will receive incremental bits as well, potentially negating the initial amount tipped if others join in.</p><p><h5><u>Bitcoin Price Analysis</u></h5></p><p>Bitcoin has seen a strong breakout since the previous session with five days of gains within the last week. With the halving event occurring in the next 100 days, the amount of new bitcoin generated will decrease as expected to stay in line with scarcity, I believe that the positive recent good news with bitcoin investment as well as development paired with the halving event are all driving the price trend upward. Fomo contrarian says short Bitcoin to $435, but permabull optimism states you should buy and hold if you're risk averse.</p></div></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ShowNews(9);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - April 12th 2016</a></h4><div class="large-11 small-12 large-centered columns news_content" style="text-align:left;display:none;" id="news_content_9"><p><h5><u>Open Bazaar goes live on the MainNet on April 4th</u></h5></p><p>The time is now. Open Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace that allows anyone with the software, the ability to buy and sell goods from anyone else, using Bitcoin. Development has been occurring for the past two years. On April 4th, the software was transitioned to Main-net from Testnet, meaning we can now legitimately use the service to buy and sell goods. Today marks the point to where anyone old enough to read could use the software to start their own virtual lemonade stand, garage sale or art gallery. Exciting changes were mentioned to come in store from @drwasho. So we'll keep our ears on the streets with updates.</p><p><h5><u>Wiper messaging app pays independent film-makers with Bitcoin</u></h5></p><p>Now in addition to Streamium and PopChest comes Wiper. As mentioned, Wiper is a messaging app that pays film-makers with Bitcoin. Like Youtube Red, Wiper Film is a new decentralized service that is offered in the messenger to allow independent film-makers to earn a portion of the revenue generated from views from within the platform. This service costs $5 per month in Bitcoin and is offered through the messaging platform.</p><p><h5><u>Barclays partners with Circle</u></h5></p><p>The British Banking Juggernaut Barclays has announced a partnership with Circle to help them debut their mainstay circle application to work with and be compatible to British Pounds Sterling. This is a milestone occasion for bitcoin news as we now have a frictionless way to convert pounds into dollars - can you say "Zero Exchange Loss?" Sounds new right? It should be as rate slippage has plagued monetary exchange since antiquity. According to Yahoo, &ldquo;For the first time any consumer in the U.S. and the U.K. will be able to beam sterling and dollars back and forth, instantly for free,&rdquo; said Jeremy Allai re, the co-founder of Circle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just never been possible.&rdquo; Circle has mentioned that further plans include expansion to the rest of Europe (with the support of frictionless conversion from Euros to Dollars) set to occur before the end of 2016.</p><p><h5><u>Happy Birthday Eligius</u></h5></p><p>Eligius.st has turned five years old! Let's tip our hats to Luke-Jr and Wizkid057 for keeping the pool going! Many Bitcoin miners will recognize this pool for their efforts as a direct, fast, decentralized mining pool. Since 2011, they have been around and made innovations such as BFGMiner, Eloipool and the ability to mine without the need to setup an account with the pool through your bitcoin address as a username. Though mining is generally out of touch portion of the bitcoin ecosystem for 90% of the participants, it may eventually see the resurgence in the far future when there are greater fees from global usage and/or old hashrate being redistributed to mining enthusiasts.</p><p><h5><u>Segnet has found its first 1.5MB Block!</u></h5></p><p>Just last week we announced the first Segregated Witness Testnet (Segnet). The block found here: https://goo.gl/Il39Qg, shows us 10,837 Inputs to a mere 232 outputs which could very well happen when consolidating dust transactions down; though this transaction shows an amount involving 800 or so BTC. Keep on the lookout for major changes as the final code for mainnet Segregated Witness is set to appear in the wild soon. A hardfork plan for the network is expected to occur in July with a timeline of one year to transition the correlated software engineering necessary to transition this solution smoothy to all stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p><h5><u>Pywallet on source forge has a wallet-stealer on it!</u></h5></p><p>Hats off Reddit's presses, d3k4y did some sleuthing and found a wallet-stealing piece of code snippet appended to a copy of Py-Wallet, the popular python-based bitcoin walletfile utility tool. Possibly forgot your Bip-39 encryption pin? Use Pywallet! Is it 2012 and you desire to do something like Coin-Control? Use Pywallet! Anyhow, the additional malicious code routes wallet information to a PHP file (likely sending a copy of the wallet.dat) to bieber.atwebpages.com which is a free subdomain hosted on top of atwebpages.com. Use this as a reminder to NEVER download software even if it's open sourced from untrusted sources. The author of the plugin uploaded this bad copy to SourceForge under a similar but different name jj-pywallet on Github as well.</p><p><h5><u>Shapeshift.io is down for maintenance after being hacked</u></h5></p><p>Shapeshift.io is a popular Altcoin Exchange that allows users to broker alt-coins using the service. No customer funds are ever stored and accounts aren't even created. Imagine the surprise everyone had received when Erik Vorhees released a public statement. Shapeshift was alerted to compromised servers along with the theft of some inventory reserve funds. Since then, they have gone into maintenance mode, shutting off all services while upgrading and security hardening infrastructure. No customer funds were ever at risk and any transactions in a process when the breach occurred have been reversed or can be reversed if reported. Shapeshift was very forward about the situation and had gone above and beyond to provide transparency regarding the situation experienced.</p><p><h5><u>Bloq (of Jeff Garzik) is now also sponsoring BitcoinJ</u></h5></p><p>Just last week we mentioned the 900K Bitcoin developer fund and the incentives program offered by Bitcoin Core's Team. To add more great news to the situation, Bloq is now sponsoring Andreas Shildenbach, the primary developer maintaining Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ Library. Do you ever spend Bitcoin from your Smartphone or Tablet? If yes, then you should probably thank these guys, possibly with a virtual beer by means of Changetip, Zapchain or Bitcoin. The announcement was received via Google Groups message from Shildenbach (https://goo.gl/40yM5O) and is welcome news to learn. The next time someone says centralization is what proliferates with respect to Bitcoin Core, you can retort with this.</p><p><h5><u>Bitcoin Price Analysis</u></h5></p><p>Bitcoin has remained sideways this past week with a few moments north of $425 on Monday before slipping back down again Tuesday; since that day it's been a small back and forth staying more subtle with each pass. Zooming outward to a 3 day interval period between candles re-affirms this period of stability continuing forward. Times of trade gain seem dim for the moment. I can't see any good news causing impacts to price so I would suggest to stay out of the market if risk averse and to potentially short to $415 if you're a risk taker as previous cycles would indicate a potential correction to happen between Sunday and Tuesday, if they did not occur on Friday (anticipate continuous sell pressure from Mining operations that need to pay overhead costs, holdovers from Thursday happen whenever speculation occurs on the anticipation of a jump).</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 8, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - April 5th 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 7, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - March 29th 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 6, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - March 22nd 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 5, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - March 14th 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 4, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - March 7th 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 3, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - February 29th 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 2, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - February 22nd 2016</a></h4></div><div class="row"><h4 class="center news_title" style="color:white;"><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="GetNewsContent('', 1, this);" style="color: #FADD85; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3x black;">Weekly Roundup - February 15th 2016</a></h4></div></div></div></div><!-- NEWS END --><div style=" background-color:#292929; "><div class="row"><div class="large-12 columns"><div class="row"><div class="large-12 small-12 large-centered small-centered columns"><p class="center" style="color:white; padding:0; margin:0;">&copy; 2013 - <span class="footer_cur_year">2016</span>, FreeBitco.in - All rights reserved.</p></div></div></div></div></div><!-- END --><div id="myModal" class="reveal-modal"><div id="create_wallet_form_div"><div class="large-12 columns"><h3><center>BITCOIN WALLET</center></h3><p>Enter your email and a password below to create a bitcoin web wallet.</p><p>Please use a valid email address in the form below as you will need to verify your email before you can start using your web wallet.</p><p>If you sign up for a web wallet, you do not need to download any software to earn or spend Bitcoins and can do so with only your wallet login link and password.</p><p class="bold">We do not store any of the data that is used to create your wallet, so please make sure that you save these details somewhere safe.<p><form action="/" method="post" id="create_wallet_form"><input type="hidden" name="op" value="create_wallet"><fieldset><div class="row"><div class="large-12 columns"><label>Your Email Address</label><input type="text" name="email" id="create_wallet_form_email"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="large-12 columns"><label>Password for your Wallet</label><input type="password" name="password" id="create_wallet_form_password"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="large-12 large-centered columns"><center><p id="create_wallet_error" style="display:none;"></p><input type="submit" value="CREATE WALLET!" id="create_wallet_button" class="button"></center></div></div></fieldset></form></div></div><div id="wallet_details" style="display:none;"><p id="create_wallet_success"></p><p>Please store your wallet login link and password safely as you will need it to access the funds in your wallet.</p><p>Your new wallet address has been pre-filled in the signup form behind.
