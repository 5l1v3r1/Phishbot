      The war of words between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton continued early Sunday morning, as he hit back at her claim that he wanted to allow guns in classrooms. Clinton made the remarks Saturday night, at a Florida fund-raiser for Circle of Mothers, an organization that aims to 'empower women to transform communities'. '(Trump says) on his first day in office, he’d mandate that every school in America allow guns in their classrooms,' Clinton claimed, according to the NY Daily News. 'That idea isn’t just way out there. It’s dangerous.'

      Disgraced former NFL quarterback Johnny Manziel is risking another run-in with the law after he allegedly punched a reveler in a Las Vegas nightclub. The Heisman Trophy winner was at Jewel Nightclub in the Aria hotel on Friday watching the grand opening show by Drake when he was jostled by another party-goer and lashed out, TMZ claims. The alleged incident comes while Manziel is already on bail over claims he attacked his ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley, hitting her so hard she lost hearing in one ear.

    <div class="text">
      Donald Trump went there. The presumptive Republican nominee brought up allegations that former President Bill Clinton committed rape in an interview with Sean Hannity - but why? Anyone who lived through the 1990s remembers that whenever Republicans bring up Clinton's sex life, it is usually the Republicans who lose. And Bill isn't the candidate this time around. His wife is. That's why so much controversy surrounded Trump's decision to lob this bombshell.

      “Therefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right” (1 Peter 4:19). The final attitude we should have in facing trials and sufferings is that of entrusting ourselves to God. Geoffrey Bull epitomizes the modern-day believer who entrusts his entire soul to God’s will in the middle of terrible suffering. Bull was punished with solitary confinement, brainwashing, many kinds of intimidation, and starvation during more than three years of imprisonment by the Communist Chinese forty years ago. During his affliction he prayed that God would...

      The twelve apostles included &quot;Matthew the tax-gatherer&quot; (Matt. 10:3). God can use you despite your sinful past. I remember reading a notice in a local newspaper announcing the opening of a new evangelical church in our community. It gave the date and time of the first services, then added, &quot;our special guest star will be . . .&quot; and named a popular Christian celebrity. In its attempt to appeal to unbelievers or simply draw a large crowd, the church today commonly uses that kind of approach. Jesus, however, used a different approach. None of His disciples were famous at all....

      Every Friday, just yards from a statue of Bill Clinton with arm aloft in a cheery wave, hundreds of young bearded men make a show of kneeling to pray on the sidewalk outside an improvised mosque in a former furniture store. The mosque is one of scores built here with Saudi government money and blamed for spreading Wahhabism — the conservative ideology dominant in Saudi Arabia — in the 17 years since an American-led intervention wrested tiny Kosovo from Serbian oppression. Since then — much of that time under the watch of American officials — Saudi money and influence have...

      The Never Trump moment is over. While a small group of Republicans has wrung its hands raw over the choice between the GOP’s nominee and Hillary Clinton, the party’s firmament – social and intellectual conservatives, the lobbyist and donor class, powerful operatives and outside groups – is increasingly getting in line behind Donald Trump. Never mind that many of them complain about his bombastic and unpredictable political style. The thawing has slowly but surely begun - and it’s visible everywhere -- from mega-donors like Foster Friess rallying Republican governors to Trump, to Mitt Romney’s allies agreeing to raise money for...

      Business has boomed in Donald Trump’s financial empire during the time he has run for president, according to an analysis of his federal disclosure forms. The documents, including a lengthy filing released Wednesday and one from last July, show that revenue has increased by what Trump campaign statements say is almost­ $190­­ million, with gains coming from golf courses to branded merchandise to book royalties. At his tony Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, revenue nearly doubled, climbing from about $16 million in 2014 and the first half of 2015 to about $30 million since the start of his campaign, according to the...

      Thereâ€™s a whole lot of good news and â€˜splodey head angst in the latest ABC/Washington Post national poll (full pdf below). The poll sample size of 1005 includes a mix of 33% Democrat, 27% Republican and 35% Independent. Democrats over sampled by eight points, (D+8).However, even with the sample skew (D+8) Donald Trump still beats Hillary Clinton 46% to 44%, and Trump is crushing Clinton with Independent voters 48% to 35%.In addition to the overwhelming 13 point polling lead among independent voters, the same poll shows that 20% of Bernie Sanders supporters will vote for Donald Trump.

      Last week an openly gay man, Eric Fanning, became secretary of the Army. Read that sentence again and contemplate what it reveals about how much and how quickly American society has changed. Only five years ago, openly gay people were barred from serving in its armed forces. During Mr. Fanning’s lengthy confirmation process, his sexual orientation was simply not an issue. That is a tribute to those who fought so hard to repeal the ban, and a measure of the nation’s at times uncertain, but as yet unfailing, march toward equality.

The legislation, sponsored by Rep.

      In denying his application for a concealed-carry permit, Oceanport Police Chief Daniel W. Barcus said Russell was unable to demonstrate “justifiable need” because there had been no specific attacks or threats made directly on him. To legally carry concealed firearms in New Jersey, residents have to apply to their local police for a permit demonstrating such a need. But critics of the state’s strict gun laws say this results in very few people other than acting and retired law enforcement officials getting approval for such permits.
