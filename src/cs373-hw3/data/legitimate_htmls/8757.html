<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">Want to succeed in Chinese business? Then re-wire your western mind</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">One of the main roadblocks to people from a western business background who are looking to expand into the Chinese market is that, in many ways, the Chinese business person and the western business person will see things entirely differently. It is not a question of one side being right and one side being wrong. It is simply the case that people from different cultures are raised to see things differently and, in the case of China and, say America or the UK, they are raised to see things very differently. <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mypubliclands/"><img width="380" vspace="5" align="right" hspace="5" height="297" class="blogimg" style="float:right" alt="" src="/config/chinalucky8.com/upload/userfiles/re-wire-your-western-mind.jpg" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">It can take years of exposure to Chinese culture for a western business person to fully appreciate all the nuances and particularities that differentiate their thinking from that of their Chinese colleagues, partners or clients.  This guide, however, can at least prepare you for what you are likely to find, with the key perceptive variances.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Example: Logic</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">In western society, logic is generally seen as a linear process. We accept A, therefore we accept B and that leads to C. One thing happens it causes another thing to happen from this we can deduce a conclusion. In other words, it's all about working out how one thing causes another thing. In Chinese thinking, things are quite different. Here, logic works in a spiral fashion. The thinking is more subtle and the connections between things are looser and less rigid or provable.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>How does this affect business?</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">This reliance on a more fluid, less structured form of logical reasoning and critical thinking means a lot more time tends to be taken over decisions. Also, a powerful Chinese business partner or potential business partner may need the benefits of a deal explained several different ways, each at great length before being prepared to shake hands.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Example: Disagreements</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">In western culture, people are generally quite willing to disagree and express their disagreement in the surest and most certain terms. In fact, in many business environments, somebody who is prepared to speak up with a dissenting voice will actually be commended for their honesty, bravery and critical intelligence. In China, openly disagreeing is seen as an almost entirely negative action. If A Chinese person does not agree with you, they will express it in less straightforward terms, often in non-verbal communication.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>How does this affect business?</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">Don't ever expect a straight no when you've made an offer. If the answer is negative, you will probably get a very roundabout, open-to-interpretation explanation that hints towards potential flaws in a proposal, yet never directly touches upon them. In fact, anything other than a very hearty &lsquo;yes' is most probably a &lsquo;no.'</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12"><strong>Example: The individual Vs. the Group</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">In the west, there is a huge premium placed upon the rights, ideas and importance of the individual. If you live in the US, Canada, the UK or central Europe, chances are you have been raised with a keen sense of entitlement regarding your rights and ambitions as a person. In China, a greater focus is put upon what an individual can contribute to the group of which they are a member, often at the expense of individual freedom or short term happiness.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14"><strong>How does this affect business?</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph15">Personal autonomy and independence are not respected or granted easily in the Chinese corporate culture. Far more important is to be part of the group and carry out your job to the best of your ability in order to contribute to the group's goal. This can be tough when you have risen through western business, with its romanticism of the maverick attitude and out-of-the-box thinker, but it is crucial to how the Chinese get business done.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">As more and more western companies and investors look east for investment opportunities, it is the perfect time to take a closer look at China's most rapidly expanding industries. China's dynamic economy and increasingly influential financial market may well dictate the future of global business. Here is a brief guide to where most of its money is being generated.<img width="380" vspace="5" align="right" hspace="5" height="507" class="blogimg" style="float:right" alt="" src="/config/chinalucky8.com/upload/userfiles/food-beverage-china.jpg" /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2"><strong>Food and beverage</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">With a population of more than 1 billion people, it should come as no surprise that there is plenty of money in food production and provision in China. As the economy soars and the middle class grows, demand for speciality foodstuffs, foreign cuisine and imported food brands is rising. This has been helped along by a number of food scares related to many of China's home-grown foods. So, if you work in the food industry, then China represents a massive potential area for growth and investment, yet it is not an easy market to enter. Given the sheer size of the country, brand recognition can take time and supermarket shelf space is priced very high.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4"><strong>Healthcare</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Again, given the sheer number of people in the country and the populations increased wealth, it is obvious why healthcare is such a growing industry. With much government support promised in the current five year plan, private hospitals, prescription medicines and medical equipment are all growing sectors. Though foreign investment will play a big part in this, it won't be a clear and easy path for even recognised foreign companies looking to make their mark in China. Foreign medical devices are generally considered more expensive than their Chinese equivalents and this perception may become more vivid as the government makes high quality healthcare more affordable for its citizens. Whatever happens, it is 100% that this sector will keep growing, mainly because it has to. There are now 185 million senior citizens in the country and that figure will only rise higher in the near future. Caring for all those people as they go through their elderly years will mean big business for somebody.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>Education</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Once again, we find the increasingly large middle class dictating what industries grow and decrease in China. As families find themselves with more disposable income, the availability of private education becomes more important. Whether fair or unfair, there is a perception amongst certain elements in Chinese society that the standard system is not doing enough to educate children to western standards. This has led to a call for more high quality fee-paying schools for the children of people who can afford them. The sector has responded by ballooning in size, with private education set to reach a market size of $102 billion this year. This includes after school tutors, private third level academies and adult education, a pretty hefty proportion of which is based in the English language. That last little fact means western companies have the upper hand in his market.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8"><strong>Green technology</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph9">It is not secret that there is an issue in some Chinese cities with pollution. Once again, as the citizens become more affluent they become more vocal about their rights to clean air and food or, at least, their vocalism becomes harder to ignore. In response, the government has dedicated a vast chunk of its most recent five year plan to greener technology and industrial practices. With investment in clean energy up 20% from last year and much more cash pouring in, any company that can help provide clean water, solar energy or decreased waste may find a bountiful market in China.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Since 1984 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has been a powerful force in the Chinese financial market. Its recent growth has been spurred on by a determined expansion into foreign markets. Thanks to its state funding (it is one of the four major government run banks), its financial clout is pretty intimidating. It owns 13% of all Chinese loan products and 15% of all Chinese deposits and, with more than 16,000 branches across the nation, it is not getting smaller anytime soon.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6"><strong>China Construction Bank</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">Another state run banking enterprise, CCS is the go-to supporter for any form of infrastructure project in the country. With 12% of the nation's loans, it is one of China's most trusted creditors.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph"><strong>Baidu&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">Think of Google. Now think of Google in a world where no other search engine is allowed to exist. That's about the best way of understanding Baidu, who claim 79% of the search engine market in China. The world's 3rd fastest growing company, Baidu dominates the technology scene in its home country despite being virtually unknown outside its borders.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10"><strong>Tencent</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph11">Tencent is China's most prominent digital communication enterprise, offering customers a plethora of online tools and services. Its catalogue includes web portals, games, chat applications and much, much more. Plus it is only getting bigger, as evidenced by its recent partnership with Disney, which will allow Tencent to distribute animated Disney content through its social networks.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph12"><strong>Agricultural Bank of China</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph13">The third state-owned bank on our list, the ABC is mainly responsible for funding small and mid-sized companies in rural China. Though it does not have the creditor power of the above mentioned banks, it is hugely influential in the agricultural sector for obvious reasons.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph14"><strong>China Life Insurance</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph15">Again we see China's growing middle class' influence over what market sector's become more powerful. More income means more people investing in things like life insurance. With the advertising power of spokesperson Yao Ming (China's most famous ex-NBA star), China Life is considered the most recognised life insurance company, just edging ahead of Ping An.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph16"><strong>Bank of China</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph17">Yes, Bank of China is the fourth of the big four state owned banks to get on our list. Considering they are funded heavily by the government, it should come as no surprise that these massive financial powerhouses are so influential in the Chinese economy.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph18"><strong>Moutai</strong></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph19">Though not traditionally a nation of heavy drinkers, China has recently begun a love affair with alcohol that shows no signs of dissipating. Though wine is the tipple of choice for many, baijiu, a high volume, clear liquid little known outside of the country, is also very popular. Moutai is its most famous producer.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph20"><strong>Sinopec</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph21">Finally, we have Sinopec, an Oil and Gas provider based in Beijing. With more foreign partnerships expected in the next few years, Sinopec will only grow more, despite the government occasionally reducing its income by forcing down the energy prices.</div>

                                            <p>Over the last few decades, since the beginning of reform and opening, China has become one of the most-watched and hippest tourist destinations in the world. Likewise, tourism in China is one of the fastest-growing markets in world and has greatly expanded over the past years.</p>

<p><span id="blogcontent" class="blogcontent">
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Indeed, with over 55 million overseas in 2010, in 2015 approx 150 million, China is the third most visited country in the world. According to the report, foreign exchange income was 45.8 billion U.S. dollars, the world's fourth largest in the same year. Meanwhile, the number of domestic tourist visits totaled 1.61 million.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">All in all, tourism is a relevant industry in China - its tourism revenue reached $ 185 billion in 2009 - and this is also due to its touristic values such as History, architecture, food, beauty and nature. Therefore, here are the top visited cities in China:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">1)	Beijing is the most visited city in the country. As the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing is not only the heart of the nation's politics, culture and international intercourse, but it is also one of the six ancient capital cities in Chinese history; therefore, it is home to relevant sites such as Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, The Great Wall, Ming Tomb, Tiananmen Square, Hutong and Yashow Market.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">2)	Shanghai comes second in the list of most visited cities in China but comes first in size. Indeed, this magnificent city is the largest metropolitan area in China and is situated in central-easter China, facing the East China Sea. Some of the sites that attract tourists include Shanghai Jade Buddha Temple, Shanghai Bund, Shanghai Xin Tian Di, Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV Tower, Shanghai Yuyuan Garden and Shanghai Huangpu River.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">3)	China's third most visited city reflects China's worldwide relevance in historical value. With over 3,100 years of history, Xian is one of the oldest cities in China. Tourists from all over the world flock to Xian to travel in time and admire the mysticism of China's ancient civilisation. Some of its most relevant attractions include Terra-cotta Army, Banpo Museum, Shaanxi Provincial Museum, Xian Great Mosque, Huaqing Hotspring, City Wall, Big Goose Pagoda and Forest of Stone Steles Museum.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">4)	Bordered by the Li River, Guilin is the most beautiful place in China. Both overseas and domestic tourist flock to Guilin attracted by its famous natural views, such as green hills, featuring rockeries, clean water, unique caves and stones of many shapes. The local colour is enhanced by the many ethnic minorities that inhabit the place. Some of its most relevant attractions include The Li River, The Reed Flute Cave, Seven Star Park, Guilin Folded Brocade Hil, Fubo Hill, Elephant Trunk Hill, Fubo Hill, Solitary Beauty Hill, Longji Terraced Field in Longsheng, Fengyu Cave in Lipu County Guiline, among others.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">5)	Some of the others popular cities include Hangzhou known as Heaven on Earth due to its beautiful natural scenery. Its most famous attraction is the city's West Lake, bordered by numerous temples, pagodas, gardens and artificial islands within the lake.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">6)	Chengdu - where the giant pandas are the major attraction - is the sixth most visited city in China.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph10">7)	Huangshan, seventh most visited city in China, is famous for its magnificent beauty. Some of the most important sites include Tunxi Ancient Street, Xidi and Hongcun Ancient Villages, Tangyue Memorial Archway, Flower Mountain and Enigma Caves.</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">Beijing, 8th most influential city in the world</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph"><a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/iqremix/"><img width="700" align="middle" height="216" class="blogimg" alt="" src="/config/chinalucky8.com/upload/userfiles/beijing-influential.jpg" /></a></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">According to the latest study by Forbes, Beijing ranks among the top 10 most influential cities in the world. The capital of the People's Republic of China and Sydney tied for the eighth spot.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Forbes also assessed that the Chinese cities Shanghai and Beijing have been gaining influence over the past years and forecasted they might move up in the list of most influential cities in the future.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph4">The study shows that size does not matter anymore, as the Chinese capital came ahead of the country's largest metropolitan area Shanghai. &ldquo;We ranked China's capital eight, ahead of Shanghai (19th)&rdquo; because &ldquo;with the advantage of being the country's all-powerful political center, Beijing is the headquarters of most large state-owned companies and is home to the country's elite educational institutions and its most innovative companies,&rdquo; the report said.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph5">Although Sydney only has 4.5 million residents, significantly less than Beijing's 21 million, the Australian city tied with the Chinese capital due to its high level of foreign investment and 15th ranking on the Z/Yen Group's 2013 Global Financial Centres Index, among other factors.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph6">London still ranks first as the most influential city in the world, even after more than a century of imperial decline, the analysts at Forbes stated. Despite describing the United Kingdom as a &ldquo;second-rate power&rdquo;, the analysts put London at the top of its power list, saying the city's &ldquo;unparalleled legacy as a global financial capital still underpins its pre-eminence&rdquo;.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph7">"A preferred domicile for the global rich, London is not only the historical capital of the English language, which contributes to its status as a powerful media hub and major advertising centre, but it's also the birthplace of the cultural, legal and business practices that define global capitalism," it said.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph8">New York, which came in a close second in the study, is home to most of the world's top investment banks and hedge funds, and the massive stock trading volume on the city's exchanges. New York is followed by Paris and Singapore in the list, which signals a shift of power to &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; cities, rather than the largest or fastest growing.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph9">To determine the most influential cities, John Korkin, urban geographer Ali Modarres, analyst Aaron Reen and demographer Wendell Cox graded 58 metropolitan areas in in eight categories: the amount of foreign direct investment they have attracted, the concentration of corporate headquarters, how many particular business niches they dominate, air connectivity, strength of producer services, financial services, technology and media power and racial diversity.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph10">Of the world's 10 most populous cities, only Tokyo, New York and Beijing made the top 10 for influence, showing that while in the past century the greatest global cities were generally the largest and centres of the world's great empires, &ldquo;today size is not so important&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph11">Among the cities on the rise, there's another Chinese city, which is Shanghai. However, these data is also relevant for the region as many of the cities which are gaining influence are in Asia, shifting the traditional influence from European and American cities to Asia-Pacific.</div>

<div id="paragraph1" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">With an increasingly prevalent market, a fast-growing economy, rising incomes and rapid urbanisation, China has become more and more modernised in the past decades, but this modernisation has come at a price - obesity issues. While the Chinese population has doubled its life span with a developed public health program, now Chinese people are suffer from diseases that are more common in wealthier nations which are not caused by malnutrition as in starvation but by overconsumption of unhealthy foods and lack of exercise.<a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/73416633@N00/"><img width="380" align="right" height="285" class="blogimg" style="float:right" alt="" src="/config/chinalucky8.com/upload/userfiles/obesity-rises-in-china.jpg" /></a></div>
<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">While the US keeps topping obesity charts worldwide, China is not falling far behind as Chinese children follow the same unhealthy American habits - junk food, sodas and couch potatoes lifestyles. &ldquo;China has entered the era of obesity. The speed of growth is shocking,&rdquo; stated a leading child-health researcher, Ji Chengye.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Indeed, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), obesity is a major health concern. While overall rates of obesity are below 5 percent in the country, in some cities these rates are higher than 20 percent.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Obesity in the Asian country is mostly prevalent in urbanised cities where fast food culture has been embraced by the society and globalisation has taken over, in contrast with poorer rural areas.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">As the McDonalisation of the global society becomes more clear and China becomes more modernised, rising incomes, rapid urbanisation and cities dotted with fast food establishments - such as McDonald's (MCD), Pizza Hut (YUM), and KFC (YUM) - growing obesity among Chinese children is becoming a relevant problem in the country. Even an expert at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Chen Chunming, has warned against the rapid growth of American fast-food outlets in China. He advises: &ldquo;Don't take children to eat fast food like McDonald's and KFC.&rdquo;</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">In fact, more than half of Chinese children eat unhealthy food - including overly sweet and salt snacks as well as fried meals - every day, according to a survey of 10,000 students in 24 schools in six Chinese cities. Meanwhile, a quarter of primary school pupils and 16 percent of middle schoolers sip sugary beverages on a daily basis.</div>
<div id="paragraph7" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">The kids' unhealthy eating habits are accompanied by a lack of exercise. According to the survey, about two-thirds of the students get less than an hour of exercise a day. Then, when it comes to exercising outdoors on the weekends, only 40 percent of primary pupils and one-fifth of middle school students engage in these kind of activities.</div>
<div id="paragraph8" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Moreover, thanks to a rapid motorisation, people are walking and cycling much more less than before. According to reports in 2002 and 2012, there is a correlation between ownership of motorised transport by households in China and higher obesity related problems in children as well as adults.</div>
<div id="paragraph9" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">According to a recent report by the University of Washington's <a target='_blank' target="_blank" href="http://www.healthdata.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a>, China is undergoing a fast rise in childhood obesity. In fact twenty-three percent of Chinese males younger than 20 are overweight or obese, while 14 perfect of their female counterparts suffer from the same condition. In contrast, back in 1990, the corresponding rate for Chinese male and female rate was less than 10 percent.</div>
<div id="paragraph10" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">China's current rates are still below those in the U.S. (almost 30 percent for young males and females), they are above than those in Japan, South Korea and India.</div>
<div id="paragraph11" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">According to the authorities, specifically Wang Longde, the Chinese vice health minister, the problem is that the population lacks awareness of the problem and knowledge in terms of what constitutes a healthy diet.</div>
<div id="paragraph12" class="paragraph2">Therefore, as a response, the government aims at reducing the problem by building more playgrounds and making it mandatory for students to exercise or play sports for an hour at school.</div>

<div id="paragraph2" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">While planning a trip to China, one can take into account these three beautiful places that will take anyone's breath away.</div>
<div id="paragraph3" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong><a target='_blank' href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickryeung/" target="_blank"><img align="middle" width="700" height="221" src="/config/chinalucky8.com/upload/userfiles/Jiuzhaigou-Valley.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
Jiuzhaigou Valley</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Situated on the north of Sichuan over the edge of the Tibetan plateau, this place is known for its multi-level waterfalls, colorful lakes, and snowcapped peaks. As the film location for many movies and Chinese dramas, this valley has become a popular tourist destination over the years. After taking look at the pictures, one would understand the appeal of such scenic lakes that have gathered numerous local legends.</div>
<div id="paragraph4" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;"><strong>Xinjiang</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">Setting out from Kashgar, the westernmost city in China, one would have to traverse one of the world's most dangerous road, Karakoram Highway to get to the glacier sea lake which is surrounded by mountains. Four hours of being on the treacherous road has not stopped globetrotters from visiting Lake Karakul.</div>
<div id="paragraph5" class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 17px;">While in Xinjiang, do take a detour to the Nalati Grassland &ndash; a meadow so distinctive that the name Nalati(&ldquo;place where the sun emerges&rdquo; in Mongolian)was given by Genghis Khan when he laid eyes on it.</div>
<div id="paragraph6" class="paragraph2">Guilin Located in northeast of Guangxi, this prefecture-level city has much to offer.

<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph2">Huangshan is located in the Anhui province, eastern China's most rural province. A well-known name, Huangshan consists of 36 separate peak with some rising above 1,800m. While this province is not the wealthiest, it is definitely compensated with its astounding natural beauty. The peaks of Huangshan are easily hiked and each year, millions of visitors come here for its magnificent sunrise views.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 17px;" class="paragraph" id="paragraph3">Originally known as Black Mountains, it was renamed Huangshan. Legend has it that an emperor rode off from these peaks to heaven on the back of a dragon. Literally translated to &ldquo;Yellow Mountain&rdquo;, this long mountain range extends across four counties. A tourist spot, there are many hostels and campsites made available for nature lovers to stay a few nights while enjoying the hike up and down Huangshan. The most popular spot to catch sunrise is the Dawn Pavilion. Less crowded spots would be a bit further in at Refreshing Terrace, Lion Peak or Red Cloud Peak.</div>
<div class="paragraph2" id="paragraph4">The hike up is pretty unchallenging. Even novice hikers will not find much difficulty climbing up. If you would like to feel safer, join a guided tour where you will hike up in a group. The peaks will definitely be colder so bring a waterproof jacket that is thick enough to withstand the cold wind. On a good day, you will be able to see the mountain range clearly with clouds floating nearby - a truly mesmerizing site that showoffs the beauty of mother nature. Once you reach the top, there are other things to do and see as well. They include the Fairy Walking Bridge, Turtle Peak, Flying Rock and of course, confronting extreme vertigo while overlooking this historical place.</div>
