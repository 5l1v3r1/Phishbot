						<p style="text-align: justify">In politics, apart from good charm, what is needed to survive is the right instinct and appeal. Now the daughter of Nandamuri Natasimham Balakrishna and daughter-in-law of Chandrababu Naidu, Nara Brahmani is all set for her moment of fame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The elegant celebrity Lakshmi Manchu organized Memu Saitham with good planning and a lot of hard work and sources say that Brahmani has also taken part in it. The telecast of this programme is yet to happen on small screen.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Nara Brahmani Memu Saitham</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Many feel that Brahmani is also very much interested in public welfare. Hence it is said that she is also being groomed and that she can become powerful lady along with Lokesh, her husband who is slowly moving up the ladder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is the step up to serve the society and at the same time to enter into politics. Sources says that she have keen interest in politics and so she is mostly participating in the social service shows. Memu Saitham is planned and many of the film celebrities are appearing in the show to help the people who are in need. To this program Nara Brahmani also stepped in and many are shocked with her presence in the television show. Let&#8217;s see what happens!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Sardaar Gabbar Singh Sydney Records</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">One has to see how the film will fare eventually at the box office because there has been no great response for the teaser. However, this is not affecting the frenzy among fans here who are awaiting the film with lot of excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Although there are many negative feed back and rumors on the Sardaar Gabbar Singh Teaser, the craze of this movie is not at all reduced.

						<p style="text-align: justify">In India, many stars are considered as demi gods. Right from North to South this is seen but in South India, hero worship takes many forms. This always continues to puzzle many others who are stunned by the worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is known that for Style Samrat Rajinikanth, such idolization crossed all limits and his fans are also known for showering his cut-outs with hundreds of liters of milk. This issue has now been taken to courts in Tamilnadu.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23870" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rajini2.jpg" alt="Rajinikanth got Legal Notice" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Rajinikanth got Legal Notice</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">In response, the courts have asked Rajini to make sure that his fans don’t indulge in such extravagance hereafter. It is up to his fans now to see that their favorite star is not questioned by courts in the future. People in Tamilnadu shows their respect in a crazy way. Now the same thing happened for Rajinikanth also.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Showering out his posters with milk is their affection towards Rajinikanth. Many sources says that it is not exactly correct to point out Rajini and ask him to attend court. If Rajini informs for his fans also many will do this again and again without his permission. Once upon a time actress Kushbu also faced this problem for her fans. Her fans said that they are building up the temple for her to show their affection. Let&#8217;s see what Rajini will do now!</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">It is not easy to gauge why some of our actors don’t perform well overseas. These days overseas business is playing a key role in ensuring good collections as well as good overall buzz for the success of the film.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are some young actors who are yet to become superstars but they are already popular with overseas audience. The variety hero with baritone voice Nara Rohit, who has been choosing variety when it comes to scripts, is also well received by audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23877" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nara.png" alt="Nara Rohit Savitri Overseas" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Nara Rohit Savitri Overseas</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">In overseas, his latest film Savitri is already doing some good pre release business with record number of screenings scheduled for the film. It is being estimated that if he really makes an impact, then this would be his strong point for collections. Even though he have some chubby look people loves his acting and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">More over his scripting choosing will be awesome. From his first movie he had chosen different type of scripts which mostly liked by the viewers. Now Nara Rohit is coming up with Savitri movie in which Nanditha is playing the lead role. Sources says that the movie is completely going to define the early marriages and the problems occurred in Savitri life. This point is attracting more to the viewers. All the Best for Savitri movie Team!</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">It is common to see how men lure women with gifts which appeal to them. Now here’s a Bollywood actress who has opened up some new discussion regarding what she wants in life and how she is also using a brand endorsement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Usually, endorsing liquor brands has been a turf of men all the time. Now, the tempting hip beauty Neha Dhupia is advertising a popular Whisky brand and her tweets in this regard are also thought provoking. Now she says one can easily lure a man with a Scotch as a gift.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">Neha Dhupia Liquor Advertising</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Clearly, this is a new thing which she has conveyed through her endorsement. Well, it is a nice thing to know that one can lure men by inviting them over a bottle of scotch for spending a nice evening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now the world has got changed more, even girls are taking up the liquor in the public by saying that it is a party culture. But no actress came forward to advertise the liquor in social media. Neha Dhupia is the one who came forward and advertising whisky brand in the social media. She posted the pictures of  this liquor in her twitter and this is pretty awesome shock for everyone.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">The popularity of Rock Star Devi Sri Prasad is well known as one of the most sought after music composers in South India. He is known for delivering unique feel of tunes for each and every film which makes him very popular.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even star heroes and directors request him openly to compose tunes for their films. Recently Megastar Chiranjeevi had requested DSP to work for his 150th film and this will happen most likely. Now sources say that he has been roped in for Balakrishna 100th film.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24034" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bala2.jpg" alt="Balakrishna Gautamiputra Satakarni" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Balakrishna Gautamiputra Satakarni</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">The film which would be directed by the intellectual film maker Krish is based on Gautamiputra Satakarni, an ancient ruler of Amaravathi. This is going to be an ambitious film if it is happening for real. There are reports that he has accepted the offer made by film makers and this is a huge delight for fans of Balayya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">They say that taking up the mantle of a producer is the most toughest and ruthless in the cinema industry but to those who play their cards rightly it is indeed a blessing. In this process, many producers keep vying for some prestigious films. Balakrishna 100th Film chance to big producer. Let&#8217;s wait and see which producer will get this jackpot.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">Telangana CM KCR is known very much for his unique style of decisions and now his recent announcement has again raised eyebrows. When he came to power in 2014, there was big announcements regarding a new film city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It was expected that this film city will be coming up near Rachakonda hills, close to Ramoji Film City. Sources say that this may not be a possibility now with the state government reportedly planning two big reservoirs near Hyderabad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24039" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kcr.jpg" alt="KCR Vote for Reservoir" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">KCR Vote for Reservoir</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">One reservoir would be coming up near Ramoji Film City with a capacity of nearly 20 tmc feet. Even Osmansagar and Himayathsagar can only store 2 tmc’s of water in total. So one can expect how huge this reservoir will be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">More over this is really a good precaution for Telangana state to have a reservoir for future. At the same time to develop themselves they also need one more film city and so there will be more craze for this city. Sources says that the reservoir is established near the Ramoji Film City and the other new film city is established in any other area which could be helpful for the film people. Let&#8217;s wait and see what CM KCR is going to do for the future benefits of the state.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
						<p style="text-align: justify">Usually National Awards announced by the Government of India are known for their different choice of films. Mostly it is Art films which have ruled the roost for a long time and hence commercial film makers lost interest in these awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But the recent list of National Awards has completely changed the perception. There has been a red carpet this time for big commercial hits, and this is for the first such time this has been seen. The magnum opus Bahubali which earned nearly 600 crores was adjudged as the best film.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24043" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/awarad1.jpg" alt="National Awards" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">National Awards</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">The best director was the colorful film maker Sanjay Leela Bhansali whose film Bajirao Mastani collected more than 300 crores and best actor was living legend Amitabh Bachchan for Piku which collected more than 100 crores. The curly haired beauty Kangana Ranaut won best actress award for Tanu Weds Manu Returns which also collected nearly 200 crores.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Similarly Best film goes to Bahubali and Kanche film also almost reached out that point. In fact the commercial films are more in now a days and this is the main reason that National Awards are mostly attracted to those films. Now a days there is more priority to movie budget rather than scripts. Many are now interested to watch out making of films rather than edited movie. So that viewers can know the hard work and technology beyond the movie.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
						<p style="text-align: justify">In Bollywood industry, usually there is some hesitation somewhere when it comes to openly accepting the greatness of the South film industry. But again this was never a hindrance to several remakes for more than three decades in Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, well known producer of Bollywood, Karan Johar is creating a new trend by buying big projects at fancy prices. It is known that Karan reaped very good profits from Bahubali and last year, he also acquired remake rights of Ok Bangaram.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24047" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/remake.jpg" alt="Karan Johar Remakes" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Karan Johar Remakes</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now he has again bought the rights for Oopiri remake in Hindi. It shows that Karan has reposed good faith in South hits and it is a welcome decision to see how a person like him is choosing South films!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the past there is a assumption that only Bollywood can make the movies of high range with ramp music and other features. But with the film Bahubali everything has got changed within a short period. Bahubali movie took out the Tollywood name and fame to high standard level. Now people in Bollywood are loving to watch the films in Tollywood and many directors are encouraged to remake the scripts of Tollywood movies to Bollywood. This is mostly got possible with the director Karan Johar and a warm respect him for accepting Telugu scripts.</p>

							<div class="entry-content">
						<p style="text-align: justify">There are some occasional instances when people from South film industries are looked down upon in Bollywood. There is a hidden anger in South that people based in Mumbai takes us for granted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There are reports that one celebrity from south Indian industry went to a music studio based in Mumbai to get the music related works done. There when he reportedly asked for tea, he was given an inferior quality tea which wasn’t nice. He then requested for another one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24051" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bolly1.png" alt="South Indian Celeb Insulted" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">South Indian Celeb Insulted</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">The reply which came to him from the music director was that this is what they could offer and he can either drink it or leave it, or he could go back to Chennai and get it done. Bollywood says there is no discrimination against South Indians, but what are these then?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is really happens form long time for South Indian celebrities in Bollywood. They feel that they are pretty damn high in making out the films. So many of the people in Bollywood behaves in the same way. But not pointing out all the people in Bollywood. There are few people who respects and gives value to the  South Indian Celeb for their work and more over as a human.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">Heroine Shanvi Srivastava made a good mark in Tollywood before she headed to Sandalwood. Her sister Vidisha is also an actress. She would be reportedly playing an important role in NTR starrer Janatha Garage. Sources say that her choice is being appreciated well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Rather than waiting for plum roles to come by and get disappointed, it is important to make sure that good roles could be taken up even if they are characters role. She will be seen as wife of Unni Mukundan and as sister-in-law for Junior NTR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-24057" src="http://ladduz.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ntr1.png" alt="NTR Janatha Garage " width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify">Actress Vidisha</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">The film has impressive star cast of Malayalees and director Koratala Siva has already made plans for releasing this movie in Malayalam. Superstar Mohanlal is playing an important role in this film which is getting ready soon. He was reportedly given a remuneration of 1.5 crores and the package included giving Malayalam rights for the film to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This was worth 1.5 crores initially but he got it for free.Now this veteran star reportedly sold the Malayalam rights for an astounding 4.5 crores. So he made a cool profit of 4.5 crores apart from his remuneration of 1.5 crores. This has left Mythri Movie Makers red faced, who had to forego such a good profit in the form of Kerala business.</p>
