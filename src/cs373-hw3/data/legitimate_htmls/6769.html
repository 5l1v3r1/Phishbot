GIF courtesy of giphy.com Chicken is a classic meal to eat because it cooks fast and there are so many different ways it could be cooked. My family and I usually have chicken two or three times a week. Sometimes we just cook it plain and then each add our own sauces, dressings, or seasonings. I am usually a picky eater but am always up for trying new things at home. What is great about all of them is that they can be prepped and made in 30 minutes or less. 1. Chicken &amp; Broccoli Sage Portobello Stir-Fry Photo by Shalayne Pulia Chicken and broccoli are two perfect combinations for any meal. There are so many benefits for eating chicken that make it much better to eat. This dinner has the added hint of sage and portobello to make it stand out from the crowd. It is perfect to make in one dish which helps a lot when it comes to cleaning up. You will definitely impress with this dish.  2. Sweet ‘n Spicy Cheeze-Its Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwiches Photo by Shalayne Pulia Do you love cheeze-itz? Then you will love these waffle sandwiches. It combines two classics: southern chicken and waffles. It might sound obscure, but it is a sweet ‘n spicy meal that can be made in 30 minutes or less. 3. Buffalo Chicken Lettuce Wraps Photo by Jackie Kuczynski Lettuce wraps are a healthy alternative to bread. They add a different taste and crunch to what you are eating. In this wrap, there is an added crunch with the peanuts and flavor with the buffalo sauce. Lettuce wraps are so beneficial for you and tasty, too. This is quick and easy meal that can be eaten for dinner or even lunch. 4. One-Pan Balsamic Chicken &amp; Veggies Photo by Jackie Kuczynski Isn’t that picture mouth-watering? Grilled chicken is very quick and easy to cook but how you dress it makes all the difference. All this takes is one pan so it makes for an easy clean-up. The vegetables are the perfect combination for this balsamic chicken dinner that can be cooked in just 20 minutes. 5. Breaded Chicken Cutlets Photo by Becky Hughes Chicken cutlets have to be one of my favorite meals because my grandpa always knew how to make them the best out of our family. We try all different ways to make them now, but this comes close. It is another quick and easy way to make a tasty meal so I don’t get hangry. 6. Chicken Alfredo Photo by Hannah Giardina Alfredo has grown on me and even more so with this recipe. Now that I am home for the summer, my mom is requesting me to make dinner once a week. This is a quick and simple dish that I can make all on my own. It is also great because I can use the leftovers to give my dad for work the next day and he can add all the seasonings he wants. 7. Tandoori Chicken Photo by David Cui Now this is something different. As I said, I love chicken and trying new things, and this is definitely one to try. It is great to be served with my favorite side of rice and a veggie. It is so quick and easy too. I’ll save this for my mom to make next week after I make the alfredo. 8. Pretzel-Crusted Honey Mustard Chicken Nuggets Photo by Emma Lally I love pretzels and chicken. This dish is a perfect combo of the two. Any sides can be added to it for a tasty meal for all. If you do not like the honey mustard, you can substitute it for another dressing like ranch. 9. Rosemary Balsamic Chicken Photo by Mackenzie Barth Have I mentioned I love chicken and a balsamic dressing? This has an added taste of deliciousness with the rosemary on top. The balsamic dressing can spruce up any dish you wish. This dish has the perfect balance of flavor and can be made in just 30 minutes. 10. Thai Green Curry with Chicken Photo by Kelda Baljon This is a perfect, warm meal for the fall, winter, and even slightly chilly spring we are having now. It is deliciously served right in the bowl so it does not take much to clean it up. Definitely a new spin to chicken dinners. 11. Teriyaki Ginger Chicken Stir-Fry Photo by Shalayne Pulia I love ordering Chinese food almost as much as I love chicken. This meal is an order I can make at home just to my liking. It is served with white rice, another one of my favorite sides. The ginger gives it an added taste to make dinner tastier. Make sure you are prepared to make stir-fry the right way. 12. Chicken Caesar Sushi Burrito Photo by Emily Bowen This dish combines a lot of America’s favorites – chicken, caesar dressing, sushi, and a burrito. It can be made in 30 minutes to make the whole family happy. 13. Chicken Parmesan Photo by Celeste Holben This is a quick and simple dinner to make that everyone will love.

Sesame Ginger Chicken Pineapple Dinner Photo by Shalayne Pulia I saved the best for last. This is my favorite because it can be eaten out of the pineapple used to cook – how cool is that? Another delicious chicken dinner served with rice and another of my favorites, pineapple. Now that you have these 15 new recipes, go ahead and make them for yourself.

Keep in mind that even the worst is still delicious. 7. Cajun Photo courtesy of @kirstenbadass on Instagram A slight dusting of Old Bay seasoning can work wonders on potatoes. The blend of spices creates a handful of flavors – smoky, salty, and tangy – that introduce new dimensions to your plain potato. Dip it in a southern remoulade for a real treat. 6. S’mores Photo courtesy of @stickysfingerjoint on Instagram Only a handful of restaurants are starting to dish out this campfire treat as a savory fare, but the ones that are have the right idea going. Gooey toasted marshmallow fluff, melted chocolate and crunchy graham crackers provide a trifecta of sweetness to counteract the salty fries. Perfect for your hangry days. 5. Chili Cheese Photo courtesy of @bestfoodlasvegas on Instagram It’s okay to get sloppy every now and then, so don’t be one of those people that uses forks on french fries. Some foods were made to be messy, chili cheese fries included. For some reason, melted nacho cheese works better than shredded cheddar, and that’s okay. 4. Salt and Vinegar Photo courtesy of @letmeseethatfoodiework on Instagram Even though the combination is usually found on crunchy potato chips, you get the same effect on fries, though it’s just a bit less satisfying. For some reason, humans seem to have a strange addiction to foods that make us pucker and sweat, but hey, we’re not complaining. #SpoonTip: Want your salt ‘n vinny fix without all the calories? Check out these roasted chickpeas instead. 3. Baked Potato Photo courtesy of @jlnorman1092 on Instagram If you’re looking for healthier ways to eat potatoes, the sour cream, chives, bacon, and cheese that are commonly put on top of baked potatoes kinda ruin that. So why not have your potatoes fried anyway?  2. Poutine Photo courtesy of @dontlickthescreen on Instagram This Canadian treat is starting to gain traction in other countries, and it’s easy to see why. The cheese curds that go on top are reminiscent of mozzarella cheese, while the gravy is just like Thanksgiving day, but better.  1. Truffle Parmesan Photo courtesy of @hashmita7 on Instagram Truffle oil is one of those things where less is more. But when done right, the combination of the earthy truffle flavor and salty parmesan cheese creates an experience like no other. It’s pretty lit when there’s parsley on top.

I had spent the majority of my life eating whatever I wanted and never gaining a pound, but when I stopped playing a vigorous sport like softball six days a week for 50 weeks out of the year, my body started responding differently. I found that I couldn’t eat those three bowls of cereal, grilled cheese, salad, and ice cream cone every day for dinner, even if I was hitting the gym most days. While I didn’t pack on that notorious freshman 15, I started to dislike the way I looked for the first time in my life. Last summer, I took the time to evaluate what I was putting into my body and devise a way to eat healthy while still having fun with food. That process, for me, started with learning the ins and outs of nutrition labels. Not only did the nutrition facts for some “healthy” foods astound me, but I was also left disgusted by some of the unnecessary additives used to prolong shelf life or simply enhance color. I also took a look at my university’s dining service website, which detailed every nutritional tidbit of most dishes and snacks on campus. A small veggie flatbread pizza, a favorite of mine, had 698 calories and a whopping 18 grams of saturated fat, 82 percent of your recommended daily intake. Pair that with a small side of mac and cheese, and you have a lunch that is doing your body some harm. Let’s look at a typical post-workout snack or light lunch: a Clif Bar and a Chobani strawberry yogurt. Photo courtesy of theconscientiouseater.com If you look at that long list of ingredients in this not-so-healthy energy bar, you may find yourself stumbling over words like “phytonadione”  or “copper gluconate.” The former is used in medicine to aid those whose blood does not clot normally, which almost seems unnecessary in a simple chocolate and nut Clif Bar. While words like “organic” seem enticing, there is much debate on whether or not the term really makes a difference in the food you’re eating. The company is certified by Quality Assurance International, a USDA-accredited agency, but to the typical college kid, there is probably little value in such a certification. As for the Greek yogurt, which is touted as an awesome fuel and a source of protein for vegetarians like me, there is a similar label. Photo courtesy of fitnessmassterminds.com While the ingredients list is substantially shorter and a 6-ounce container contains 14 grams of protein, the sugar content was the most alarming tidbit on the label. The American Heart Association recommends that women consume approximately 25 grams of sugar per day, but these few scoops of yogurt contain just six grams short of that. Pairing the yogurt with the Clif Bar, which has a colossal 22 grams, means that you would be consuming almost double the recommended amount. Photo courtesy of wisegeek.com In a 2014 study done by Harvard, high sugar intake is positively correlated with an increase in the risk of heart disease. Beyond the yogurt and Clif Bar is a whole list of food marketed as “healthy” that all contain added sugar. Now, I  am the friend constantly reminding those around me of what’s actually in our food. The information is right in front of us, yet a vast majority neglect or simply skim the label. The FDA just announced a change in the way labels are presented, meaning that information on risks and links to certain diseases are starting to be included. Hopefully making information more digestible will entice people to scrutinize their daily consumption habits. If you’re still lost on what your nutrition labels are really telling you, take a look at these four tips to deciphering them. Healthy eating doesn’t have to be intimidating, and it most definitely can be fun. So grab that nearest cereal box or can of ravioli and get to know your food.

Our parents constantly remind us how lucky we are to be able to guzzle down cheap beer four nights a week without a resulting beer gut (nothin’ wrong with a dad bod though). However, some of us may be all too aware that we’re no longer #blessed with every 17-year-old’s ability to plow through a bag of pizza rolls at midnight and still awaken the next morning with a tight stomach. Gif courtesy of giphy.com The 20-somethings of the world exist in a weird metabolic middle ground. Sure, half of our friends seem unaffected by the late-night stress snacking that characterize the college years. The other half worries constantly about what they’re eating, how to speed up their metabolism, how to keep their weight from fluctuating, and so on. After some scientific research (or should I say Internet research), I’ve discovered the ins and outs of our metabolisms, and how to tell whether or not yours is slowing down. Here’s what you need to know. Let’s start with the basics, shall we? Your metabolism converts the food and beverages you consume into energy for your body. Age, gender, and body size all influence the speed of an individual’s metabolism. These are not new facts — many of us have watched as our guy friends eat mounds of food while remaining as fit as ever. Meanwhile, if I even look at a French fry I feel bloated for days. Gif courtesy of quotes gram.com These factors determine metabolic speed only to a certain extent. Girls, in general, tend to have slower metabolisms than guys, for example. Even if a middle-aged female’s metabolism may not move as quickly as a teenage boy’s, she can still be characterized as normal for her age and gender. Those who fall into the “slow metabolism” category experience certain symptoms. Low or accelerated thyroid activity, dry hair or skin, difficulty concentrating, and frequently feeling cold are all prominent. Experiencing slow weight loss and quick weight gain also most commonly occurs among those with slow metabolisms. This can be caused by genetics or underlying health issues. Fear not, though — truly low metabolisms are actually relatively rare. Gif courtesy of giphy.com Looking to speed things up? Simply adding exercise into your weekly routine could do the trick. Good news for all you couch potatoes: even 30 minutes of walking counts as enough exercise. Foodies will also rejoice to hear that eating certain foods can have a positive effect on metabolism.

Sure, half of our friends seem unaffected by the late-night <a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/what-stress-eating-during-finals-looks-like\">stress snacking</a> that characterize the college years. The other half worries constantly about what they’re eating, how to speed up their metabolism, how to keep their weight from fluctuating, and so on.</p><p>After some scientific research (or should I say Internet research), I’ve discovered the ins and outs of our metabolisms, and how to tell whether or not yours is slowing down. Here’s what you need to know.</p><p>Let’s start with the basics, shall we? Your metabolism converts the food and beverages you consume into energy for your body. Age, gender, and body size all influence the speed of an individual’s metabolism. These are not new facts — many of us have watched as our guy friends eat mounds of food while remaining as fit as ever. Meanwhile, if I even look at a <a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/common-thoughts-every-pitt-student-ordering-o\">French fry</a> I feel bloated for days.</p><div id=\"attachment_162450\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Gif courtesy of quotes gram.com\" class=\"size-full wp-image-162450\" src=\"http://pitt.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2016/05/tumblr_mh7slh7VLx1qlkai7o1_500.gif\" alt=\"Gif courtesy of quotes gram.com\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gif courtesy of quotes gram.com</p></div><p>These factors determine metabolic speed only to a certain extent. Girls, in general, tend to have slower metabolisms than guys, for example. Even if a middle-aged female’s metabolism may not move as quickly as a teenage boy’s, she can still be characterized as normal for her age and gender.</p><p>Those who fall into the “slow metabolism” category experience certain symptoms. Low or accelerated thyroid activity, dry hair or skin, difficulty concentrating, and frequently feeling cold are all prominent.</p><p>Experiencing <a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/the-unexpected-reason-millennials-could-be-gaining-weight\">slow weight loss </a>and quick weight gain also most commonly occurs among those with slow metabolisms. This can be caused by genetics or underlying health issues.

I’m completely comfortable on a field, but drop me in the middle of a weight room and I have no idea what to do. The weight room has always been a daunting place for me. Everyone there is strong and super intimidating. I was aware of my lack of knowledge, but I assumed I could figure it out. When I first went to the weight room, I copied people who seemed to know what they were doing. You can probably imagine how surprised I was once I realized I couldn’t do the exercises. If you haven’t experienced this before, newsflash: being in cardio shape does not translate at all to the weight room. Shock Gif courtesy of giphy.com The first emotion I experienced was shock. Complete and utter shock. I’ve run a half marathon and I can handle hill repeats and stairs. But shoulder presses? Nope. Bench press? Not even. Barbell squats? No way. Even exercises with no weights, like push-ups and pull-ups, are extremely far from my capability. This is when I realized the tough lesson that being in cardio shape does not mean I can lift weights. Although strength training compliments your cardio and can improve your running, just because you’re great at one thing does not mean you’ll automatically be great at the other. Embarrassment and Anger Gif courtesy of giphy.com After the shock, the embarrassment and anger hit. I expected myself to be able to lift weights, but I couldn’t and that’s when the embarrassment hit. I may be advanced in cardio, but it’s a humbling experience to start at the bottom for strength training. I go from killing a 5 mile run to lifting little 5 pound weights. Not only is that hard enough to adjust to, but I’m often surrounded by a group of people who are lifting much heavier weights than I am. It’s uncomfortable, embarrassing and upsetting, in addition to the typical gym typical gym struggles. That’s when the anger develops. It takes a while to come to terms that all your hard in the cardio world doesn’t translate to strength training. I kept thinking “all that work for nothing,” but you can’t let yourself get disheartened. Strength training simply requires a different type of training, one that we often aren’t taught.

Turns out, I can’t expect to be great at strength training if I don’t put in the work. If you’ve only done cardio in your life, do not expect to be good at strength training at first. The first time few times you strength train, it will be hard, painful, uncomfortable, and very confusing. The good part is that it’s supposed to be all those things because it’s new to you. Embrace the fact that you’re a beginner and be ready to learn. If you can get through the shock, embarrassment and anger of having to essentially start over, strength training has numerous health benefits. A friend last semester told me that once she started strength training and got the hang of it, it became addictive. Personally, I haven’t experienced that yet, but fingers crossed I do soon.

A taste of your favorite snack brings back fond memories of trading with your friends during lunch time or paying your nearest corner store a mere penny for a snack. Wherever you may have grown up these colorful, yummy, and artificial snacks are sure to evoke feelings of nostalgia. 1. Cheetos vs. Shrimp Chips Photo by Maria Clemente Cheetos are a classic; you can have them cheesy or flaming’ hot. But the best part, they are sure to leave your fingers covered with cheesy flavor dust goodness. Shrimp chips are definitely less messy. Skeptics may frown at the sight of seafood but the snack offers that satisfying umami flavor. Although Shrimp Chips are a good contender, nothing beats licking your fingers after eating a bag of Cheetos (you’re lying to yourself if you deny it). Winner: Cheetos 2. Dunkaroos vs. Yan Yan Photo by Maria Clemente These two childhood snacks are the fun ones that you gotta dip before you eat. Or, if you really knew what was up, you ate the frosting – no biscuits necessary. Check out this 3-ingredient Dunkaroo dip that will have you partying like it’s 1996 if you really want to relive the nostalgia. Winner: Tie Gif courtesy of 90s90s90s.tumblr.com 3. Jell-O Snack Packs vs. Assorted Jellies Photo by Maria Clemente Finding these in your lunch bags were the ultimate day-maker. While Jell-O Snack Packs were bigger and needed a #spoon to be eaten like a civilized human, Assorted Jellies were mini versions that meant you can eat five or maybe 10 at a time. Turn this childhood snack into a sophisticated adult beverage with this red wine Jello shot recipe. Winner: Assorted Jellies 4. Animal Crackers vs. Hello Pandas   Photo by Maria Clemente Let’s put it this way, one of these involves chocolate. One is dry, boring and flavorless. Need I say more? Winner: Hello Pandas 5. Starburst vs. Hi-Chew Photo courtesy of playbuzz.com This one can be tough because of their extremely close similarity; both offer juicy and fruity flavors. But some have proclaimed otherwise, stating that Hi-Chew is the “smarter, sexier, tastier Japanese cousin” of Starburst. One can’t possibly argue with that description. Winner: Hi-Chew Photo by Maria Clemente 6. Milk vs. Yakult   Photo by Maria Clemente Throwback to the days of those celebrities with milk mustaches plastered all over your middle school hallways. Milk is a hallmark of our growth, quite literally. Yakult didn’t receive the same extravagant campaign besides the lady on your street who would yell out “YAKULT!!!” over and over until you came out of your house. Winner: Milk Photo courtesy of Prairie Farms 7. Cocoa Puffs vs. Koko Krunch Photo Courtesy of Buzzfeed.com If spelling’s high on your rubric, then we have an obvious winner in this category. But if it isn’t, the shapes of these are the biggest difference. Cocoa Puffs were perfectly round while Koko Krunch’s shape might have slightly injured the roofs of your mouth. Take Cocoa Puffs to the next level with this 3-step Nutella Cereal recipe.

It’s known to make you cry, fight and profess your love to your high school ex at 2 am over text. But, there are actually many benefits to picking tequila over other types of alcohol. 1. It reduces blood sugar Photo by Katherine Richter Agavins, the natural occurring sugars found in tequila, were proved to reduce blood sugar, especially compared to other sugars found in other alcohols. These sugars can’t be metabolized by humans, meaning they don’t contribute to blood sugar levels. You know what that means: the four cookies you ate earlier totally don’t count anymore. 2. It can aid in weight loss Photo by Nicole Laszlo Thanks to agavins, tequila has also been proven to aid in weight loss and even limit the development of fat. Say goodbye to alcohol bloat! Tequila shots are basically a diet food. 3. It lowers your cholesterol Photo courtesy of bngrill.com Tequila was also found to lower levels of LDL cholesterol, the bad kind of cholesterol that builds up in the walls of blood vessels from eating red meat, eggs and other high-fat animal products. 4. It cleanses your colon Photo courtesy of flickr.com Scientists found that agave, the main ingredient in tequila, works as an effective way to deliver drugs to the colon. It’s even more effective than conventional drug delivery systems. This is great news for anyone suffering from Crohn’s disease, IBS and other colon-related illnesses. Medicinal marijuana is so old news, we’re ready for medicinal margaritas. 5. It may help fight your next cold GIF courtesy of giphy.com Historically, Mexican doctors prescribed tequila shots with lime to help fight the common cold. Sure, maybe this one is a bit of a stretch, but a tequila shot sounds like much more fun than Dayquil. 6. It helps prevent osteoporosis Photo by Stephanie Lee According to the American Cancer Society, the agave in tequila also promotes the absorption of calcium, which strengthens bones and prevents bone-related diseases like osteoporosis. We’ll let you be the ones to try chasing tequila with milk though. 7. It makes you a better dancer Photo courtesy of giphy.com Or at least it makes you think you’re a better dancer. On second thought, maybe it’s time for you to go home. I think you’ve taken too many tequila shots. No, seriously, the Macarena is not cool. It never was. Drink responsibly. Drink tequila.

Long live H-Town.</p><h3>1.

You can start right here at Les Givral’s, where chicken and pork, grilled to perfection, are sandwiched between baguettes to give you the sweetest sounding crackle when you bite into them. These bánh mì are a friendly $2.50 each, which can be both a blessing and a curse to your wallet.</p><h3>5. Crepes at <a href=\"http://www.sweetparis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet Paris</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9598\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9598\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/gabbyphi-11.06.01-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"738\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram</p></div><p>Unlock your inner Parisian with any delicately delicious crepe from Sweet Paris.

These Chicken &amp; Waffle Fryders will make you take a moment to appreciate the great culinary heights that are being reached with all things fried. What a time to be alive.</p><h3>7. Wild Game Hot Dogs at <a href=\"http://damngoodfoodcoldassbeer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Moon Tower Inn</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9554\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9554\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/IMG_9346.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedia on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"642\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram</p></div><p>If wild boar and duck foie gras hot dogs led you to believe that this is some trendy, wannabe-fancy hot dog joint, you’d be gravely mistaken. Situated in Houston’s Second Ward, Moon Tower Inn serves up wild game hot dogs that are creative, but far from pretentious. Sitting in the large yard, sipping on one of the 66 beers they’ve got on tap and biting into their apple brandy duck wiener dogs = perfect Friday night.</p><h3>8. Flip BBQ Skewer Plate at <a href=\"http://www.flipnpatties.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flip’n Patties</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9549\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9549\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/IMG_9340.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"550\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram</p></div><p>While the delectable steamed bun burgers are what Flip’n Patties is known for, their Flip BBQ skewers are hard evidence that Filipinos got their pork game ON LOCK. The patriotic feels I get when eating these juicy pork skewers laid atop a steamy bed of Sinagag (Filipino garlic rice) are only comparable to the emotions I felt when Pia Alonzo Wurtzbatch was crowned Ms. Universe.</p><h3>9. Kouign Amann at <a href=\"http://wearecommonbond.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Common Bond</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9329\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Jamie Medina\" class=\"size-large wp-image-9329\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/03/kouign-amman-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Jamie Medina\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Jamie Medina</p></div><p>Literally any baked good that you pick up at Common Bond will have you feeling #blessed. Kouign Amann is sort of like a densely packed croissant, made up of flaky, buttery layers and finished off with a crunchy, caramelized sugar glaze. If you want this little taste of heaven, get there early — these babies don’t stay in the case for long.</p><h3>10.

These chocolate chip cookies might cost you a little more than your average cookie, but no one leaves Tiny Boxwoods without grabbing one of these melt-in-your-mouth morsels for themselves.</p><h3>11. Vietnamese Crawfish at <a href=\"http://www.thelacrawfish.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LA Crawfish</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9547\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @bayoucitybites on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9547\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/bayoucitybites.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @bayoucitybites on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"726\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @bayoucitybites on Instagram</p></div><p>Some of the best crawfish to be had during crawfish season can be found at this stall at the 99 Ranch Market in Memorial.

The only one of these cupcakeries worth visiting is Crave. You can always count on these baby cakes to be perfectly moist, rich and undeniably adorable.</p><h3>13. Baos at <a href=\"http://www.fatbaohouston.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fat Bao</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9557\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @fabihurtado on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9557\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/fabihurtado.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @fabihurtado on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"777\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @fabihurtado on Instagram</p></div><p>Bao in Chinese translates to package or bag, and Fat Bao is known for their little steamed bun purses, which are rich in fillings.

Triple Heart Clogger at <a href=\"http://www.hubcapgrill.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hubcap Grill</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9556\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @bestfoodhouston on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9556\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/bestfoodhouston.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @bestfoodhouston on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"758\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @bestfoodhouston on Instagram</p></div><p>This simple burger hut serves up big burgers to some of Houston’s favorite chefs. Gluttons can relish in the Triple Heart Clogger, which is composed of a beef patty, bacon and grilled sausage. Still not satisfied? The Quadruple Heart Clogger’s additional chili cheese fry topping is sure to make you go up a pant size.</p><h3>15.

In Cloud 10’s rendition of the classic sundae, three scoops of their innovative ice cream flavors are flanked by blow-torched bananas and topped with fruit jams, a chocolate magic shell and Nutella powder, all made in-house.</p><h3>19. Two to Tango Tapioca at <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/honey-bee-teahouse-houston\" target=\"_blank\">Honey Bee Teahouse</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9335\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy user Delirium T. on Yelp\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9335\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/03/honeybee.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Courtesy of Yelp user Delirium T.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy user Delirium T. on Yelp</p></div><p>Houston is sprawling with various teahouses that feature delicious drinks, but Honey Bee Teahouse is the only one that serves drinks the same size as quarts of queso. The Two to Tango smoothie drink with their honey tapioca is the perfect combination of mango and strawberry swirl to cool you down on a hot day (basically every day in Houston).</p><h3>20. Crunchy Chicken Sandwich at <a href=\"http://www.houstonlocalfoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Local Foods</a></h3><div id=\"attachment_9562\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo courtesy of @justclairefying on Instagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9562\" src=\"http://texas.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2016/04/justclairefying.jpg\" alt=\"Photo courtesy of @justclairefying on Instagram\" width=\"750\" height=\"805\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo courtesy of @justclairefying on Instagram</p></div><p>You really can’t go wrong with any of the sandwiches at Local Foods, all of which are prepared fresh with locally sourced ingredients.

America’s best food cities, Houston is finally getting the recognition it deserves for some of the best eats in America. As the fourth largest city and one of the most diverse metropolitan areas in the US, Houston is home to a delicious mix of cuisines that make up its food scene (no surprise here). Whether you’ve been reppin’ Space City since birth or are new to Screwston (see more of Houston’s many nicknames here), here’s 50 of Houston’s edible essentials that you should have before leaving this Earth. Long live H-Town. 1. Chicken &amp; Waffles at The Breakfast Klub Photo courtesy of @sherry_fortune on Instagram A looong line of people start queuing up early in the morning to get into this Houston establishment. Every one of them will tell you that this chicken/waffle combo is more than worth it. 2. Pad Thai at Tony Thai Photo courtesy of femme_foodie on Instagram There are a lot of good places to score good Thai food in the Bayou City, but no one does pad thai quite like Tony Thai. They’ve mastered the perfect balance of flavors in this iconic dish, and give you enough for leftovers you can look forward to. 3. Beignets at Chez Beignets Photo courtesy of @notfaithda on Instagram Right after you eat dinner at Tony Thai, run next door to Chez Beignets for the fluffiest fried dough pillows you can find outside of New Orleans. You can spot elderly Vietnamese people chatting and munching away on these blissful beignets late into the night, so don’t hesitate to bring yourself and your crew in for a midnight snack. 4. Bánh Mì at Les Givral’s Photo by Jamie Medina If you haven’t gotten a hold of one of these Vietnamese subs before, it is time for some major life adjustments. You can start right here at Les Givral’s, where chicken and pork, grilled to perfection, are sandwiched between baguettes to give you the sweetest sounding crackle when you bite into them. These bánh mì are a friendly $2.50 each, which can be both a blessing and a curse to your wallet. 5. Crepes at Sweet Paris Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram Unlock your inner Parisian with any delicately delicious crepe from Sweet Paris. Something about brunching at this cute crêperie will transport you out of the humid Houston heat, and make you feel like you’re at a French street-side cafe, if only for a few hours. 6. Chicken &amp; Waffle Fryders at The Waffle Bus Photo courtesy of Adam D. on Yelp Just when you thought chicken and waffles couldn’t get any better, the geniuses at The Waffle Bus food truck squeezed lil’ nuggets of chicken in between golden waffle fries, then drizzled it in their own special spicy mayo. These Chicken &amp; Waffle Fryders will make you take a moment to appreciate the great culinary heights that are being reached with all things fried. What a time to be alive. 7. Wild Game Hot Dogs at Moon Tower Inn Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram If wild boar and duck foie gras hot dogs led you to believe that this is some trendy, wannabe-fancy hot dog joint, you’d be gravely mistaken. Situated in Houston’s Second Ward, Moon Tower Inn serves up wild game hot dogs that are creative, but far from pretentious. Sitting in the large yard, sipping on one of the 66 beers they’ve got on tap and biting into their apple brandy duck wiener dogs = perfect Friday night. 8. Flip BBQ Skewer Plate at Flip’n Patties Photo courtesy of @jamiekatemedina on Instagram While the delectable steamed bun burgers are what Flip’n Patties is known for, their Flip BBQ skewers are hard evidence that Filipinos got their pork game ON LOCK. The patriotic feels I get when eating these juicy pork skewers laid atop a steamy bed of Sinagag (Filipino garlic rice) are only comparable to the emotions I felt when Pia Alonzo Wurtzbatch was crowned Ms. Universe. 9. Kouign Amann at Common Bond Photo by Jamie Medina Literally any baked good that you pick up at Common Bond will have you feeling #blessed. Kouign Amann is sort of like a densely packed croissant, made up of flaky, buttery layers and finished off with a crunchy, caramelized sugar glaze. If you want this little taste of heaven, get there early — these babies don’t stay in the case for long. 10. Chocolate Chip Cookie at Tiny Boxwoods Photo courtesy of @j.ackie on Instagram Tiny Boxwoods is one of Houston’s premiere brunch spots, and their pastry chef just happened to be on Top Chef: Just Desserts. These chocolate chip cookies might cost you a little more than your average cookie, but no one leaves Tiny Boxwoods without grabbing one of these melt-in-your-mouth morsels for themselves. 11. Vietnamese Crawfish at LA Crawfish Photo courtesy of @bayoucitybites on Instagram Some of the best crawfish to be had during crawfish season can be found at this stall at the 99 Ranch Market in Memorial. Put a bag of their Cajun flavor in one hand, a bag of their garlic butter crawfish in the other, and feel good about double fisting.  12. Cupcakes at Crave Cupcakes Photo by Jamie Medina The height of the American cupcake craze brought about a ton of average cupcake specialty shops. The only one of these cupcakeries worth visiting is Crave. You can always count on these baby cakes to be perfectly moist, rich and undeniably adorable. 13. Baos at Fat Bao Photo courtesy of @fabihurtado on Instagram Bao in Chinese translates to package or bag, and Fat Bao is known for their little steamed bun purses, which are rich in fillings. Pair pork belly baos with a side of curry fries for a full foodie experience. 14. Triple Heart Clogger at Hubcap Grill Photo courtesy of @bestfoodhouston on Instagram This simple burger hut serves up big burgers to some of Houston’s favorite chefs. Gluttons can relish in the Triple Heart Clogger, which is composed of a beef patty, bacon and grilled sausage. Still not satisfied? The Quadruple Heart Clogger’s additional chili cheese fry topping is sure to make you go up a pant size. 15. Macarons at SWEET Photo by Gabby Phi Any Houston girl knows that a box full of SWEET macarons is worlds better than a box of chocolates for any special occasion. If you’re a single lady, be your own bae and treat yourself to the variety of yummy flavors available at the macaron counter. 16. Thai Style Ice Cream at Class 502 Photo courtesy of @kathleen.jl on Instagram Thai Style Ice Cream has arrived in Houston at this classroom-themed tea shop. Sip on some milk tea while you watch your favorite ice cream and mix-ins get rolled up into a bouquet of pretty ice cream rolls. 17. Brisket at Killen’s Barbecue Photo courtesy Janice L. on Yelp BBQ reigns supreme wherever you go in Texas, and Houston is no exception. Ranked as the second best barbecue destination in America, Killen’s, in the Houston suburb of Pearland, is serving up barbecue that is just as good (if not better) than its Texas Hill Country competitors. Line up for the hype-worthy brisket and stay for the croissant bread pudding. 18. Banana Split at Cloud 10 Creamery Photo courtesy of @cloud10creamery on Instagram When Houston native Hilary Duff sang “This Is What Dreams are Made Of” in the critically-acclaimed The Lizzie McGuire Movie, I’d like to think she was singing about this banana split. In Cloud 10’s rendition of the classic sundae, three scoops of their innovative ice cream flavors are flanked by blow-torched bananas and topped with fruit jams, a chocolate magic shell and Nutella powder, all made in-house. 19. Two to Tango Tapioca at Honey Bee Teahouse Photo courtesy user Delirium T. on Yelp Houston is sprawling with various teahouses that feature delicious drinks, but Honey Bee Teahouse is the only one that serves drinks the same size as quarts of queso. The Two to Tango smoothie drink with their honey tapioca is the perfect combination of mango and strawberry swirl to cool you down on a hot day (basically every day in Houston). 20. Crunchy Chicken Sandwich at Local Foods Photo courtesy of @justclairefying on Instagram You really can’t go wrong with any of the sandwiches at Local Foods, all of which are prepared fresh with locally sourced ingredients. The Crunchy Chicken sandwich, paired with their giant, homemade potato chips make for a solid lunch option. 21. Fajitas at Ninfa’s on Navigation Photo courtesy of @jordanarothman on Instagram If you wanna get your fajita fix in, Ninfa’s is the OG place in Houston to get some Tex-Mex. Ninfa’s has several locations in the Houston area, but none of them compare to the place where it all started. Visit this historic gem for beef fajitas that are tender and charred just right. 22. Biscuits and Marmalade at Blacksmith Photo courtesy of @bl4cksmith on Instagram Biscuits are serious business in the South, and Blacksmith makes sure to deliver. This coffee shop has a pretty appealing menu that might make you skip over the biscuits to order something more filling, BUT DON’T DO IT. These buttery scratch-square biscuits are perfectly complemented by the cool and tangy crème fraîche and marmalade, making it something you definitely do not want to miss out on. 23. Tacos at Tacos A Go-Go Photo courtesy of @tanybrown on Instagram Hit up Tacos A Go-Go for some flavor-packed, no-frills tacos in either Midtown or the Heights. The barbacoa and carne guisada tacos are so juicy and cheap that you can easily feast here for a very small fee. 24. Snow Cones at Friohana Photo courtesy of @friohana on Instagram The phrase “Everything’s Bigger in Texas” is perfectly demonstrated at Friohana. These colorful little mountains of ice they call snow cones definitely come in clutch during the summer when you need a refresher. 25. Loaded Gogi Fries from Oh My Gogi! Photo courtesy of @trey_flow on Instagram While Oh My Gogi! is not the originator of kimchi fries, they have certainly mastered the art of making them. It might not exactly be #cleaneats #paleo #anythingremotelyhealthy, but sometimes you gotta do your stomach a favor and devour some fries covered in bulgogi and kimchi. 26. Asian Bread at Six Ping Bakery Photo courtesy of @amyiferz on Instagram Step into Six Ping and prepare to be overwhelmed by the variety of baked goods you can buy. Everything is dirt cheap too, meaning you can buy as many taro-stuffed buns and custard-filled breads as your little heart desires. 27. Fried Chicken at Frenchy’s Photo by Phaedra Cook Spicy chicken skin so crispy and flavor-packed that it puts KFC to shame. According to Beyoncé, it’s the best thing to eat in all of H-Town. The Queen has spoken. Need we say more? 28. Snow Shaved Ice at Nu Cafe Photo courtesy of @hi_imnina on Instagram These towering stacks of thinly shaved ice, drizzled with toppings such as mixed fruit, condensed milk and tapioca pearls will make any prior shaved ice experience you’ve had seem very, very sad. 29. Gyros at Niko Niko’s Greek &amp; American Cafe Photo courtesy of @goinskate on Instagram No Houston bucket list is complete without a mention of Niko Niko’s, a Greek family-owned institution in the heart of Montrose. Order the gyro sandwich and be greeted by a plate overflowing with more gyro meat and French fries than you could ever dream of. 30. White Chocolate Bread Pudding at Ruggles Green Photo courtesy of @paperdawns on Instagram Warning: eating this bread pudding might ruin all other bread puddings for you. But with an award-winning bread pudding adorned with warm raspberry sauce, a dark chocolate trellis and organic vanilla ice cream, how could you not? 31. Gateway of India Pizza at Bombay Pizza Photo courtesy of David D. on Yelp When you’re dreaming about your ideal slice of pizza, chances are that Indian flavors do not cross your mind. However, the cilantro-mint chutney pizza sauce, Tandoori chicken and fresh crab meat on the wafer-thin crust of the “Gateway of India” work together so well, it earned this pizza a spot on Food Network’s “The Best Thing I Ever Ate.” 32. All-You-Can-Eat Hot Pot at Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram If you’ve never given hot pot a try, Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is a good place to start. For $22, you get an infinite amount of meats and veggies to cook in a steaming pot of their original or spicy broth. 33. Traditional Breakfast at Kraftsmen Cafe Photo courtesy of @gabbyphi on Instagram Grab the Traditional Breakfast at Kraftsmen Cafe for a simple breakfast done right. Sitting in this textile mill-turned-cafe and brunching on their perfectly crisped bacon and potatoes is a swell way to start your Sunday in Syrup City. 34. Dumplings at Fu Fu Cafe Photo courtesy of Allen A. on Foursquare While each and every dish is guaranteed to please at Fu Fu Cafe, you can’t walk away from here without getting any of their dumplings. From pan-fried pork dumplings to soup dumplings that burst in your mouth, Fu Fu’s homemade-tasting dumplings are as authentic as it gets. 35. Roast Beef Noodle Soup at San Dong Noodle House Photo courtesy of @cade.mueller on Instagram The rich and beefy cure to all of your future hangovers. If getting wasted tonight means a trip to San Dong Noodle House tomorrow, you’ve got a reason to look forward to the morning after. 36. Butter Chicken Kolaches at Pondicheri Photo courtesy of @cheapeatsinhouston on Instagram Houston is ranked one of the most diverse cities in America, and its fusion of different cultures’ cuisines is a direct reflection of that. Where else on Earth can you find the happy union of Indian and Czech/Slovak cultures that is the Butter Chicken Kolache? Only Houston. 37. Vietnamese Steak and Eggs at Tout Suite Photo by Nicole Medina Sister restaurant to the aforementioned SWEET, Tout Suite is a great place to go if you want to want to impress visitors with a nice brunch, or if you just want to people-watch at this hipster hotspot. Their juicy Vietnamese steak and eggs with baguette and liver pâté is just as Instagram-worthy as this renovated warehouse’s atmosphere. 38. Donuts at Christy’s Donuts Photo courtesy of @hannahhmillerr on Instagram Shipley’s is for sure a Houston staple, but Christy’s Donuts gives them a run for their money. Seven bucks will not only get you a dozen light and airy donuts, but you’ll get a couple of their donut holes sprinkled in there, because the people at Christy’s are saints. 39. Black Pepper Lobster at Confucius Seafood Restaurant Photo courtesy user Anj G. on Yelp Pretty sure there is no such thing as bad tasting salt &amp; pepper/black pepper anything when it comes to Chinese food. Black Pepper Lobster however, takes things to a whole ‘notha level. Crunchy, meaty, lip-smackin’ lobster is attainable at Confucius at such a cheap price that you will definitely wonder how on Earth you’re so blessed. 40. Tibs at Blue Nile Ethiopian Restaurant Photo courtesy Maria Samantha A. on Yelp Go utensil-less at Blue Nile and enjoy a traditional Ethiopian meal with the hands that God gave you. The Awaze Tibs, a stew made of tender beef chunks sautéed with veggies, is a fiery, spicy dish that will leave your heart feeling warm and tingly. 41. Famous Fried Cauliflower at Roost Photo courtesy of @rani.eats on Instagram Dancing veggies don’t just exist on Veggie Tales. Lightly fried cauliflower florets are covered in bonito flakes that wiggle and dance around due to the heat from the cauliflowers underneath. The crispy but creamy umami cauliflower are not only a spectacle for your eyes, but also for your tastebuds. 42. Siphon Coffee at Siphon Coffee Photo courtesy of @jarrodmathis on Instagram Coffee connoisseurs will definitely appreciate the unique Siphon method that uses halogen burners to bring out the flavors of their artisan coffee beans. Even if you’re no coffee expert, what’s not to like about drinking yummy coffee that seems like a hipper version of your middle school science experiments? 43. Baklava at Phoenicia Specialty Foods Photo Courtesy Shawn S. on Yelp Phoenicia is an ethnic grocery that specializes in (but is not limited to) Mediterranean foods. Their bakery serves up pastries like almond croissants and chocolate tortes comparable to that of a French patisserie; but the true star of their bakery is their giant array of baklava. You can get specialty baklava that are chocolate or cream-filled, but nothing compares to the pistachio-filled, sticky-sweet original. 44. Chai Tea Coconut Ice Cream at Fat Cat Creamery Photo courtesy of Cindy H. on Yelp Lactose intolerant people, rejoice! Fat Cat’s Chai Tea Coconut is decadent, not too sweet and dairy-free. Fat Cat has a good amount of unique ice cream options that have milk in them, but this friendly option will not make you pay for it later. #SpoonTip: Get your ice cream in a brown butter waffle cone or you’re doing it wrong. 45. Dan Dan Noodles at Mala Sichuan Bistro Photo courtesy of Mala Sichuan Bistro Out of all the delicious Chinese eateries along Bellaire Boulevard, no one does spicy food quite like Mala Sichuan Bistro. Chewy noodles drenched in an addicting sauce await you at this Szechuan-style eatery. 46. Bò Lúc Lắc at Mai’s Restaurant Photo courtesy of @jiggah12 on Instagram Mai’s in Midtown is a much nicer alternative for late night eats than grabbing some Mickey D’s. Bò lúc lắc, Mai’s signature dish, features beef so garlicky and tender that you might not want to share. 47. Spicy Seafood Soup at Korean Noodle House Photo courtesy of @gregdropsoup on Instagram Sometimes all you need is some soup so hot and spicy it makes your nose run. The Spicy Seafood Soup at this home-turned-noodle house fits the bill, and after you’ve consumed all of their famous complimentary kimchi, it’s sure to set your mouth on fire in the best possible way. 48. Dim Sum at Fung’s Kitchen Photo courtesy of @lifestyleblog on Instagram Weekend dim sum here is a Houston experience: the mixing of loud-voiced customers and the sound of carts hauling around their different dim sum from table to table make for a lively, almost hectic atmosphere. A Sunday lunch at Fung’s might be far from peaceful, but the reason why everyone and their mom is there is because Fung’s dim sum is authentic (and delicious) AF. 49. Bayou Goo at House of Pies Photo courtesy of @softtboiled on Instagram House of Pies is a restaurant and bakery where magical, memorable evenings unfold. All of the pies in this classic diner are simple and made with love, and the signature Bayou Goo, layered with custard, chocolate and whipped cream on a pecan crust, is no exception. If you ever find yourself inside The Loop on a late night, stop inside this glowing beacon of friendship, nostalgia and pie craftsmanship. 50. Barbecue at the Bookity Bookity Boudain Man  One of Houston’s best kept secrets is a tiny white trailer tucked away in a Walmart parking lot. Word-of-mouth has led Houstonians to the legendary Boudain man, who draws in customers with his hospitality and delicious venison and boudain sausages. The Boudain man really only provides info for the trailer’s location and hours via his own personal Facebook page.

After five days he lost 5 pounds; by the end he’d lost 10. <em>Impossible</em>, I thought. After spending a semester abroad in Florence, I was having serious gelato withdrawals. Could Halo Top be the answer to my frozen-treat prayers?</p><div id=\"attachment_161254\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Meredith Davin\" class=\"size-large wp-image-161254\" src=\"http://duke.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2016/04/IMG_5753-copy-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Meredith Davin\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Meredith Davin</p></div><p>The following day, I bought two pints at Whole Foods to try it. This isn’t fake ice cream that tastes like frozen water (I’m looking at you, <a href=\"http://spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/we-tasted-tasted-dairy-and-gluten-free-ice-cream/\"><strong>Arctic Zero</strong></a>). As someone who has tried two different juice cleanses in her life, I desperately wanted to do this “ice cream cleanse.” For science, of course. Ten days seemed excessive, so I decided on five.</p><p>My top two concerns were cost (unfortunately, Halo Top isn’t on <a href=\"https://duke.spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/students-spend-food-points/\"><strong>Duke</strong> <strong>Food</strong> <strong>Points</strong></a>…could I start a GoFundMe to pay for this?) and the days without coffee. Luckily, when I reached out to Halo Top in hopes of collaboration, their CMO generously offered to ship me twenty-five pints.</p><p>I did some research to determine what exactly I’d be putting in my body. I discovered that erythritol is a sugar alcohol with zero glycemic index (no calories, holla), but it looks and tastes like sugar. However, it’s been recorded to <strong><a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/researched-sugar-substitutes-dont/\">cause digestive upsets</a></strong> when consumed in large quantities.

I started to spread the word that my dream of an all ice cream diet was finally becoming a reality.

I felt like Hannah Montana – a normal college student who doubles as a (not-so-secret) ice cream<strong> </strong>connoisseur. Was I finally getting my fifteen minutes of fame?</p><p>Everything was going great until our on-campus concert later that night. As we danced to Sean Kingston’s “Fire Burning,” my friends were already discussing ordering pizza or driving to <strong><a href=\"https://sewanee.spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/genius-cook-out-hacks-you-need-to-try/\">Cook Out</a></strong>. I couldn’t handle it.</p><p>As visions of pizza danced in my head, I returned home to eat my last pint of ice cream for the day – half Mint Chip and half Chocolate. I named it “Thin Mint Ice Cream” after the beloved <a href=\"https://emory.spoonuniversity.com/Recipe/life-changing-no-bake-girl-scout-cookie-truffles/\"><strong>Girl Scout Cookies</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"attachment_161253\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Meredith Davin\" class=\"size-large wp-image-161253\" src=\"http://duke.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2016/04/IMG_5769-copy-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Meredith Davin \" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Meredith Davin</p></div><h3>Day 2</h3><p>I woke up around 9 with a slight headache and a bloated stomach. I begrudgingly opened my freezer to pry out a pint of Vanilla. I set out to the <a href=\"https://washu.spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/6-quiet-library-proof-snacks/\"><strong>library for the day</strong></a> and didn’t return until midafternoon. I wasn’t even hungry at this point, but demolished a pint of Lemon Cake in minutes. I was becoming an expert ice cream eater. Still, my energy was wiped and focusing on homework had been extremely difficult. I made the mistake of telling some friends. Panic ensued.</p><h3><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-161313\" src=\"http://duke.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-12-at-4.14.13-PM-1024x982.jpg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-12 at 4.14.13 PM\" width=\"1024\" height=\"982\" /></h3><p>I ensured them that the ice cream was low in sugar and high in protein. Plus I was <strong><a href=\"https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/these-foods-can-replace-your-daily-vitamins/\">taking a multivitamin</a></strong> to make up for some of the missed nutrients. It’s not like I was eating five pints of Ben &amp; Jerry’s a day. I would be just fine.</p><p>My family was less than concerned. “Please post more pictures about your ice cream,” my 15-year-old sister said sarcastically. But I had bigger fish to fry than fighting with my teen sister; my dry ice had evaporated. I set out for solution and came back from the gas station with two giant bags of ice.</p><div id=\"attachment_161275\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Meredith Davin\" class=\"size-large wp-image-161275\" src=\"http://duke.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2016/04/IMG_5830-copy-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Meredith Davin\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Meredith Davin</p></div><p>That night, my roommate couldn’t stop talking about ordering Domino’s.

Maybe with <strong><a href=\"https://nu.spoonuniversity.com/Recipe/how-to-steam-a-sweet-potato-in-the-microwave\">a side of sweet potato</a></strong>.

After five days he lost 5 pounds; by the end he’d lost 10. Impossible, I thought. After spending a semester abroad in Florence, I was having serious gelato withdrawals. Could Halo Top be the answer to my frozen-treat prayers? Photo by Meredith Davin The following day, I bought two pints at Whole Foods to try it. This isn’t fake ice cream that tastes like frozen water (I’m looking at you, Arctic Zero). As someone who has tried two different juice cleanses in her life, I desperately wanted to do this “ice cream cleanse.” For science, of course. Ten days seemed excessive, so I decided on five. My top two concerns were cost (unfortunately, Halo Top isn’t on Duke Food Points…could I start a GoFundMe to pay for this?) and the days without coffee. Luckily, when I reached out to Halo Top in hopes of collaboration, their CMO generously offered to ship me twenty-five pints. I did some research to determine what exactly I’d be putting in my body. I discovered that erythritol is a sugar alcohol with zero glycemic index (no calories, holla), but it looks and tastes like sugar. However, it’s been recorded to cause digestive upsets when consumed in large quantities. Well, godspeed. Graphic by Meredith Davin Depending on the flavor, a pint of Halo Top has either 240 or 280 calories. My daily caloric intake would total between 1240 to 1280 calories with 120 grams of protein. I could hardly contain my excitement. I started to spread the word that my dream of an all ice cream diet was finally becoming a reality. A few days after the order was placed, a gigantic box filled with dry ice arrived at my doorstep. Photo by Meredith Davin I updated my Facebook profile picture explaining the “Halo Top Diet,” along with a disclaimer that cautioned others about trying this at home. The responses were overwhelming: after a few hours I had over 380 Facebook likes and dozens of comments.  Needless to say, this was not good for my ego. I was so excited, I felt like it was Christmas Eve. I had noble intentions to eat a healthy dinner for my last real meal – maybe a salad with salmon? I ate pizza. Day 1 I jumped out of bed around 8 am on Friday and made a “Strawberry Lemonade Smoothie” – half a pint of Strawberry and half a pint of Lemon Cake mixed together. This is going to be incredible, I thought as I giddily spooned the ice cream into a cup. Photo by Meredith Davin I bounced between classes, meetings, and trips back to my dorm room to grab ice cream from my freezer. As I walked through campus, half a dozen people stopped me to ask about the diet. I felt like Hannah Montana – a normal college student who doubles as a (not-so-secret) ice cream connoisseur. Was I finally getting my fifteen minutes of fame? Everything was going great until our on-campus concert later that night. As we danced to Sean Kingston’s “Fire Burning,” my friends were already discussing ordering pizza or driving to Cook Out. I couldn’t handle it. As visions of pizza danced in my head, I returned home to eat my last pint of ice cream for the day – half Mint Chip and half Chocolate. I named it “Thin Mint Ice Cream” after the beloved Girl Scout Cookies. Photo by Meredith Davin Day 2 I woke up around 9 with a slight headache and a bloated stomach. I begrudgingly opened my freezer to pry out a pint of Vanilla. I set out to the library for the day and didn’t return until midafternoon. I wasn’t even hungry at this point, but demolished a pint of Lemon Cake in minutes. I was becoming an expert ice cream eater. Still, my energy was wiped and focusing on homework had been extremely difficult. I made the mistake of telling some friends. Panic ensued.  I ensured them that the ice cream was low in sugar and high in protein. Plus I was taking a multivitamin to make up for some of the missed nutrients. It’s not like I was eating five pints of Ben &amp; Jerry’s a day. I would be just fine. My family was less than concerned. “Please post more pictures about your ice cream,” my 15-year-old sister said sarcastically. But I had bigger fish to fry than fighting with my teen sister; my dry ice had evaporated. I set out for solution and came back from the gas station with two giant bags of ice. Photo by Meredith Davin That night, my roommate couldn’t stop talking about ordering Domino’s. We’re both relatively healthy eaters, except for the occasional failed-my-stat-test pizza. “If you eat some,” she said, “no one has to know!” “Kayla,” I exclaimed, “it doesn’t work that way!” I went to bed dreaming about cheesy bread. Again. Day 3 The carb cravings had subsided and now, at 9 am on a Sunday, all I wanted was a heaping bowl of freshly washed spinach. Maybe with a side of sweet potato. Instead, I took out my breakfast, the Napoleon: a mix of Chocolate, Vanilla and Strawberry. Photo by Meredith Davin Creativity was the only thing keeping me going. I really couldn’t handle this ice diet anymore. I repeated my friend Elena’s mantra to myself, mind over matter. At this point, all my friends (and the entire Duke student body) were aware of the ice cream diet. I received upwards of a dozen texts a day. People were amused, excited and confused.  I was basically famous at this point. Sunday turned out to be torture-Meredith-with-food day. I had to attend two dinners and politely sip water through gritted teeth. The second dinner (with my a club lacrosse team) was bearable only because I’ve sworn off Chipotle post-E. coli scare. I brought my pint of melting Mint Chip as my teammates chowed down on chips and guac. In other news, when I returned to my dorm room, I found that my makeshift freezer was room temperature. I bagged the next two days’ worth of ice cream, labeled them aggressively, and put them into the communal dorm freezer. Secretly, I hoped someone would eat them… Photo by Meredith Davin I went to bed with a stomach full of liquid ice cream, confused as to how I was still surviving. Day 4 Monday morning, I went downstairs to the common room to find that someone had eaten all of my ice cream. Joking – every pint was still there. I wished to eat anything but ice cream. My mouth was dry and my head throbbed. I felt like I had gotten four hours of sleep and been stranded in the middle of desert. Except that I’d slept for eight and always drink 64 ounces of water a day. I received a text from my best friend asking to meet up for lunch. Normally I would have turned the opportunity down, but Kaley had purchased a pint of Halo Top and wanted to eat it with me in solidarity. This is what friendship looks like, folks. Photo by Nora Ghanem Walking back from class, I checked my phone and saw that I’d a missed call from Domino’s. A few weeks ago they had messed up my order. They’d contacted me to rectify the situation with a free pizza or cheesy bread of my choice. MY CHEESY BREAD PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED. I could not wait for the diet to end so I could place my order. Thank you Jesus, thank you pizza.  I didn’t fully understand the beating my body was taking until my club lacrosse game that night against UNC. Not to worry – I was only scheduled to play for ten minutes in the game, but when I arrived to warm up, I knew even that might be too much. After the first few minutes of drills, I could feel the dizziness set in. This could get really bad, I thought. I was temped to give up on the diet. At that point, I had sacrificed playing time, countless meals with friends, and now my physical health. Was it worth it? In the second half, UNC forfeited the game after a player got injured. An unfortunate event for my team, but truthfully very fortunate for me. The score was 6-6, so we technically didn’t lose? #GTHC. As the rest of the team celebrated with cookies, brownies and sheet cake, I chewed my cinnamon gum and had an internal battle. Should I give this up for the sake of my health and sanity? Photo by Meredith Davin I decided I would push through. One more day. I could practically taste the cheesy bread. Day 5 At 9:15 am, I couldn’t get out of bed. “I can’t do this anymore!” I whined at my roommate. I wanted to stage a photo holding my five remaining pints to show off my impending success. Kayla had an incredible idea. Queen B and her Grammys have nothing on me and my ice cream.  Photo by Kayla Seltzer I left my room to go buy more plastic spoons and unashamedly ate a pint in our student union as passers-by judged me. The rest of the day was very uneventful. I spent a lot of time in the library studying, writing this article, and counting the hours until I could eat solid food again. Photo by Meredith Davin I posted my final Instagram on @madebymer, concluding this chapter of my ice cream filled life. I had emerged victorious. Five days. Twenty-five pints. One girl who might never want ice cream again.

By day five in his diet, our friend over at GQ had lost 5 pounds.

Plus, they have a personal chef who makes their meals and they don’t have cheat days. Can somebody say #goals?</p><p>I’m really into <a href=\"https://michigan.spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/guide-popular-diets/\" target=\"_blank\">fad diets</a>. I love the challenge of limiting myself for a few weeks and then returning to my typical eating habits. I’ve been vegan for a week, vegetarian for two weeks, and paleo for a couple weeks as well, so of course I wanted to try this out. I thought it would be perfect to eat like someone who gets paid to be in bathing suits right before bikini season, so I started the diet.</p><h3><strong>Day One: High morale, optimistic thoughts</strong></h3><div id=\"attachment_156740\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Gif courtesy of giphy.com\" class=\"size-full wp-image-156740\" src=\"http://bc.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2016/04/giphy-1-1.gif\" alt=\"gif courtesy of giphy.com\" width=\"500\" height=\"201\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gif courtesy of giphy.com</p></div><p>The first day was challenging, but no more challenging than the first day of any other diet I had tried. My biggest struggle was breakfast. I literally had no idea what to eat. I knew Tom didn’t eat fruit, but I wasn’t sure whether or not Giselle did, and I had no idea if eggs were even allowed on this diet.</p><p>So I struggled hard and settled for a banana, because sometimes Tom eats them in <a href=\"https://delaware.spoonuniversity.com/Recipe/4-smoothies-get-shape-summer/\" target=\"_blank\">his fruit smoothies</a>. The rest of the day was fairly easy, and I went for a salad and some chicken at dinner, figuring this is what I would be eating for the rest of the week.</p><div id=\"attachment_156751\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Tori Weber\" class=\"wp-image-156751 size-large\" src=\"http://bc.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2016/04/IMG_1498-min-670x503.jpg\" alt=\"diet\" width=\"670\" height=\"503\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Tori Weber</p></div><p>Twenty-four hours after the start of this diet, I could hear my stomach rumbling from just looking at the bags of chips lining my dining hall. For some reason, this diet was hitting me hard. I felt so limited, partially because I could probably eat only 20 percent of the things my school had to offer, but mainly because the few items I was actually allowed to eat were not really BC dining’s “chef d’oeuvres.”</p><h3>Day Two: The peak of unhappiness</h3><div id=\"attachment_157048\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"gif courtesy of giphy.com\" class=\"size-full wp-image-157048\" src=\"http://bc.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2016/04/giphy-2.gif\" alt=\"gif courtesy of giphy.com\" width=\"245\" height=\"152\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">gif courtesy of giphy.com</p></div><p>The second day I woke up yet again unsure of what to eat for breakfast. So, I skipped breakfast and settled for coffee. By the way, not only is this extremely unhealthy but Tom and Gisele don’t have caffeine. Call that a cheat meal I guess?</p><p>I <a href=\"https://www.spoonuniversity.com/How%20To/5-deceptively-unhealthy-items-to-never-put-in-your-salad\" target=\"_blank\">usually eat salads for lunch</a>, but for some reason on this bleak day two, my normal lunch routine was nauseating. I managed to keep myself busy for the rest of the day so that by dinner I could unhappily eat dry chicken and some sort of greens mixture that the BC dining halls see fit as our nightly dose of vegetables.</p><h3><strong>Day Three: The end is near</strong></h3><div id=\"attachment_156752\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img data-portal-copyright=\"gif courtesy of tumblr.com\" class=\"size-full wp-image-156752\" src=\"http://bc.spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2016/04/tumblr_nxnqnbsByU1uug6ybo1_500.gif\" alt=\"gif courtesy of tumblr.com\" width=\"500\" height=\"270\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">gif courtesy of tumblr.com</p></div><p>I woke up the third day of my diet knowing in my soul that I could not continue. As I trudged to the dining hall, I couldn’t think of my breakfast banana without wanting to vom. So instead, I made a beeline to the breakfast line and devoured <a href=\"https://www.spoonuniversity.com/Recipe/make-beet-home-fries-just-like-east-side-king\" target=\"_blank\">two helpings of home fries</a>. Boom. Diet over.</p><h4><strong>So, here’s what I learned:</strong></h4><p>I am not a supermodel and I am not a professional athlete. I don’t have a personal chef. I am a college student. Okay, so yeah I knew all of those things going into this experiment. But those facts all taught me that it was <strong>ridiculous of me to expect myself to be able to complete this diet.</strong></p><p>Gisele Bundchen doesn’t have to <a href=\"https://www.spoonuniversity.com/Lifestyle/how-to-pull-an-all-nighter-thats-actually-productive\" target=\"_blank\">stay up all night studying for econ midterms</a>. So she probably doesn’t need to drink caffeine. But I do. It is her job to look good. Likewise, Tom works out for A LIVING. I use cardio machines a few times a week (if I’m feeling motivated). I should never have expected myself to be able to stick to this diet, just like I shouldn’t hold myself to the same standards as a supermodel and an NFL quarterback.</p><p>Personally, I think they’re crazy. This diet made me miserable.

I figured Gisele was a vegan and Tom ate as many carbs as any other professional athlete does, but I was completely wrong. The couple’s diet consists of 80 precent vegetables, which absolutely baffled me since I pat myself on the back when I choose sweet potato fries over regular fries. Gif courtesy of giphy.com Basically, Tom and Gisele eat organic vegetables (but not tomatoes because they’re allegedly inflammatory), whole grains, and lean meats. They avoid sugar, flour, and all sources of caffeine. Plus, they have a personal chef who makes their meals and they don’t have cheat days. Can somebody say #goals? I’m really into fad diets. I love the challenge of limiting myself for a few weeks and then returning to my typical eating habits. I’ve been vegan for a week, vegetarian for two weeks, and paleo for a couple weeks as well, so of course I wanted to try this out. I thought it would be perfect to eat like someone who gets paid to be in bathing suits right before bikini season, so I started the diet. Day One: High morale, optimistic thoughts Gif courtesy of giphy.com The first day was challenging, but no more challenging than the first day of any other diet I had tried. My biggest struggle was breakfast. I literally had no idea what to eat. I knew Tom didn’t eat fruit, but I wasn’t sure whether or not Giselle did, and I had no idea if eggs were even allowed on this diet. So I struggled hard and settled for a banana, because sometimes Tom eats them in his fruit smoothies. The rest of the day was fairly easy, and I went for a salad and some chicken at dinner, figuring this is what I would be eating for the rest of the week. Photo by Tori Weber Twenty-four hours after the start of this diet, I could hear my stomach rumbling from just looking at the bags of chips lining my dining hall. For some reason, this diet was hitting me hard. I felt so limited, partially because I could probably eat only 20 percent of the things my school had to offer, but mainly because the few items I was actually allowed to eat were not really BC dining’s “chef d’oeuvres.” Day Two: The peak of unhappiness gif courtesy of giphy.com The second day I woke up yet again unsure of what to eat for breakfast. So, I skipped breakfast and settled for coffee. By the way, not only is this extremely unhealthy but Tom and Gisele don’t have caffeine. Call that a cheat meal I guess? I usually eat salads for lunch, but for some reason on this bleak day two, my normal lunch routine was nauseating. I managed to keep myself busy for the rest of the day so that by dinner I could unhappily eat dry chicken and some sort of greens mixture that the BC dining halls see fit as our nightly dose of vegetables. Day Three: The end is near gif courtesy of tumblr.com I woke up the third day of my diet knowing in my soul that I could not continue. As I trudged to the dining hall, I couldn’t think of my breakfast banana without wanting to vom. So instead, I made a beeline to the breakfast line and devoured two helpings of home fries. Boom. Diet over. So, here’s what I learned: I am not a supermodel and I am not a professional athlete. I don’t have a personal chef. I am a college student. Okay, so yeah I knew all of those things going into this experiment. But those facts all taught me that it was ridiculous of me to expect myself to be able to complete this diet. Gisele Bundchen doesn’t have to stay up all night studying for econ midterms. So she probably doesn’t need to drink caffeine. But I do. It is her job to look good. Likewise, Tom works out for A LIVING. I use cardio machines a few times a week (if I’m feeling motivated). I should never have expected myself to be able to stick to this diet, just like I shouldn’t hold myself to the same standards as a supermodel and an NFL quarterback. Personally, I think they’re crazy. This diet made me miserable. Food is one of the best parts of my day, but I guess if you’re a supermodel/married to a supermodel/an NFL quarterback/married to an NFL quarterback you have better things to look forward to. As a proud Patriots fan I want to thank Tom Brady for taking care of his precious body. You are the GOAT, Tom. gif courtesy of giphy.com My final words on this “week” in hell: I love eating cheese.
