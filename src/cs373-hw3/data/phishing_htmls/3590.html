<p>Jewelry not just reminds us of our vital relationships, it also helps memorialize those unique occasions. By knowing more about precious jewelry, and the purchasing and selling process in certain, you will discover the purchase of each piece a fulfilling and remarkable experience.</p>
<p>Keep your precious jewelry resembling brand-new by wiping it with a polishing cloth. This simple method can make your precious jewelry intense and glossy without using harsh solvents and chemicals. You just need to polish each piece the like you would polish glass making use of the two-sided cloth. One side is developed to polish, and the other is used to make the piece sparkle.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth for all of your precious jewelry pieces. In this means, you will not need to deal with chemicals or solvents while you accomplish the sparkle you enjoy. To clean your jewelry, acquire a soft two-sided cloth and delicately rub in a circular movement. The first side is designed to polish, while the other is for including shine.</p>

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Try to avoid cleaning it with harsh chemicals like ammonia or turpentine. These chemicals can turn stones dull and even erode the enamel.</small></div>

<p>If you are shopping unmarked sterling silver jewelry, then by all means bring a magnet. When you do this, you become able to find fake pieces of any type of sterling jewelry. You can use the magnet because non-precious metals actually are attracted by magnets. You can recognize sterling silver by stamps that say &#8216;.925&#8217; or &#8216;ster&#8217;. If a particular piece is not stamped, you should be cautious of its authenticity.</p>
<p>Make sure a piece of jewelry is still in style before you buy it. The only thing better than picking up a gorgeous bauble is getting it on sale!</p>

<p>Keep your jewelry from getting tarnished in order to keep it looking it&#8217;s best. When wearing your jewelry, you should avoid exposure to water. This could cause your jewelry to rust or become more dull. For added protection for your jewelry, try adding a thin coating of clear nail polish.</p>
<p>A magnet is a useful tool when shopping for jewelry in sterling silver. Precious metals, like sterling silver, will not be attracted to the magnet. Your sterling silver jewelry should always be imprinted if it is real. The stamp may read &#8220;.925&#8221; or &#8220;ster&#8221;. If you cannot find a stamp, you might be looking at a cheap imitation.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>

<p>Most of today&#8217;s jewelry is manufactured. Machine made jewelry is much more economical, not only for the consumer, but also for the manufacturer. Casting machines now quickly process into uniform molds such components as metals, plastics, and resins, enabling even intricate jewelry designs to be created with speed and consistency for the majority of <a title="Awesome Boston Handcrafted Jewelry" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/awesome-boston-handcrafted-jewelry/" target="_blank">Boston jewelry manufacturers</a>. Mechanical punch presses and forges, likewise, are also commonly used in the jewelry manufacturing industry today, to help ensure the manufacture of an uniform, highly profitable product.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, <a title="What is Handmade Jewelry?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handmade_jewelry" target="_blank">handmade jewelry</a> has become quite sought after. The jewelry industry has seen a resurgence of demand for handmade jewelry due to a great perceived value of being unique and one-of-a-kind. Given this renewed interest in handmade, many Boston jewelry designers are seeing greater demand for their talents and designs for unique handmade jewelry. Many specialty galleries &#8212; as well as major department stores &#8212; now feature an increasing array of handmade jewelry. The internet has also made handmade jewelry very accessible to a world wide following. Many handmade jewelry artisans can enjoy the benefits of selling directly to a world-wide clientele.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you know that it goes without saying, but I&#8217;ll say it anyways&#8230;. always choosing quality over quantity when it comes to your handmade jewelry purchases, especially it this is a gift. If you are comparison shopping, don&#8217;t get suckered in to thinking a larger piece is a better value if the quality isn&#8217;t equal to smaller sized jewelry that is better made. Always go for quality! Remember that a good piece of handmade jewelry by a jewelry designer in Boston doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s expensive. It does not take quality and look that truly counts, not the amount paid.</p>

<p>Handmade jewelry is crafted by hands, instead of mechanically created using machines. In its purest form, hand-assembled does not mean handmade. Handmade and hand-assembled are totally unrelated, but commonly misunderstood by both consumer and designer. Attaching machine made components to one another by hand does not make the piece handmade. Jewelry designers that pride themselves in making handmade jewelry use old metalsmithing skills such as fabrication and simple tools and an extensive repertoire of techniques to create shapes and forms. One of the key indicators that a piece of jewelry is truly handmade is through observation of dissimilarity. Does the piece have uniform or varied hammer marks? Individuality, culture, and meaning are clearly evident in handmade objects. Making marketable and sought after handmade jewelry requires a considerable amount of dedication, skill, and creativity not often found in most mass-produced jewelry. This is clearly evident in a finished piece of handmade jewelry, making artisan designed jewelry a clear stand-out from most cookie cutter mass produced jewelry.</p>
<p>Mass-produced or machine-made jewelry typically looks more rigid and uniform. Even though handmade jewelry might appear to be slightly flawed in the eyes of the casual observer, high quality handmade jewelry should nonetheless last a lifetime. Perhaps surprisingly, machine-made jewelry often breaks more easily than well-made handmade jewelry. Keep in mind that just because it says &#8220;handmade&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s high quality. Many department stores sell jewelry labeled as &#8220;handmade&#8221; but this doesn&#8217;t mean high quality, as well as may not even mean handmade, but hand-assembled. Mass-production facilities typically require artisans to meet efficiency quotas that result in poorly made jewelry, made with cheaper materials &#8212; even if it is technically created by hand. <a title="The Blog of Handmade Jewelry" href="http://www.handmade-jewelry-blog.com" target="_blank">Search for handmade jewelry that is not mass-produced</a> &#8212; not available in large quantities. If you are looking for high quality handmade jewelry in Boston, look for the artisan&#8217;s name attached to the piece. This represents both reputation and quality. The careful observer will always be able to appreciate the uniqueness and quality of a handmade piece of jewelry. With handmade artisan jewelry, quality and uniqueness are typically are apparent to even the most casual observer.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of wearing hand crafted jewelry is that it was created with a craftsperson that loves what they&#8217;re doing and is enthusiastic about their work. No two creations are alike, that makes wearing something one-of-a-kind far more enjoyable. Jewelry is an art form. This strength of feeling comes across in the design process, and in the finished jewelry itself. Mass-produced items, whether it&#8217;s jewelry or anything handmade lacks this &#8220;soul. &#8221; Hand-made jewelry also better displays the wearer&#8217;s individual touch and style, articulating individuality and interest. To wear mass-produced jewelry, of a common style, lends the wearer the appearance of being somewhat mass-produced. Simply put, mass-produced is just that&#8230; cookie cutter soulless jewelry with no special meaning, no story to tell, no life. When&#8217;s the last time you told a story about that one pair of earrings you bought from your favorite Boston department store ( you know, the one&#8217;s picked from twenty identical pairs)? Probably never. With handmade jewelry, it&#8217;s a pleasure to be able to tell admirers the story behind what you are wearing. Most importantly, it is simply a joy to put on jewelry that someone has personally and lovingly developed by hand.</p>

<p>People tend to overlook their backyards when it comes to collecting, but with the energy shortage (and the price of gasoline) one should try and find a place to collect close to home. I know, that’s easy to say if you happen to live in Butte or Bisbee, but what about Milwaukee or Chicago?</p>
<p>A trip to Upper Michigan and the Copper Country is the answer.  Whether your a fan of<a title="Designer Handmade Copper Jewelry" href="http://www.handmadecopperjewelry.com" target="_blank"> copper jewelry</a>, or just love to collect minerals and rocks.  Situated on that long peninsula that sticks out into Lake Superior, it extends west as far as Porcupine Mountain State Park, and south as far as Baraga. The mines themselves line up on either side of M-26, and any pile of rocks you see can be a rockhound’s dream.</p>
<p>It would take a book to locate and describe all the different mines and their particularities. Since I’m not writing a book I’ll stick to the minerals I’ve found and the mines I’ve visited for the past two summers.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the minerals you’re likely to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copper: A metal detector is not necessary for finding copper. It occurs as round ‘shot” filling bubbles in the basalt, masses and sheets filling cracks, and as crystals. Look for rocks with a greenish color, those with an irregular shape, rocks which are cracked but don’t split apart, and in short, anything that doesn’t look like a rock.</li>
<li>Silver: Once you’ve found it there’s no mistaking it. It usually is found with the copper, and looks like silver.</li>
<li>Mohawkite: Actually a mixture of copper arsenides (domeykite, algodonite, and whitneyite). It’s metallic, silver to copper colored, but much harder and tougher than the metals. It’s usually found massive with. ankerite (a mineral resembling calcite). When it’s found with milky quartz, it becomes a valuable cabbing material.</li>
<li>Quartz: It’s found in vesicles (bubbles) and seams, Colored, clear, and milky; crystalline and massive. The easiest way to find good crystals is to look for seams of calcite. Sometimes between the calcite and the wall rock there is a layer of quartz. Dissolve the calcite away with acid, and you’ll have a nice specimen.</li>
<li>Prehnite: A pale green mineral usually found with calcite. Look for it the same way you would for quartz. When prehnite occurs with quartz, the locals call it “patricianite” and use it for cabbing.</li>
<li>Epidotc: Shiny dark green crystals lining vesicles in the basalt.</li>
<li>Datolite: If there was one stone that the Copper Country was most famous for, it has to be datolite. It’s not easy to find, but it’s worth the trouble to look for. It comes in round nodules with a cauliflower-like surface. It looks a lot like California howellite, but comes in colors, from white to chocolate brown, with the yellows and greens the rarest. Datolite also occurs in salmon red crystals in the fissure mines at the northern end of the district.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now that you know what to look for, starting at the south end of the district, this is where to look.</p>

<p>The Minesota mine, near Rockland, can blame the misspelling of its name on an illiterate clerk who drew up the first company charter. It was one of the first paying mines in the district, and can trace its history back 2,000 years. The miners of the 1840’s. just located the old Indian pits and continued downward. It’s possible to find all the minerals on the list except mohawkite. Copper and calcite are the most abundant, and in some spots good crystals can be found. If you are up there in the Fall, climb to the top of the hill. The fall colors are terrific with the red maples, the yellow tamaracks, and the little pond reflecting them all.</p>
<p>The Mass mines and the Caledonia mine near the town of Mass have always been productive collecting spots. Good crystalline copper and silver can be found there, along with a lot of datolite. You’re also likely to find quartz, adularia, and calcite. The closest of these mines is right beside the old road to Greenland, and they extend back into the woods for several miles. Be careful of your car, the roads are rough, and it’s best to ask for good directions at the bank in Mass. The Caledonia mine was the scene of one of the few “disasters” in the <a title="Upper Michigan’s Copper Country" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/upper-michigans-copper-country/">Copper Country</a>. The 80-year-old Caledonia was being reopened in the 1950’s when a gas explosion killed eight miners, so you see, it’s not only the coal mines that have gas. In this case the methane was formed by rotting underwater timbers in the old workings. Everyone knew that the gas was there, the miners said that the water was “carbonated” with methane, but none expected it would go off.</p>
<p>If your time is limited and you have to pick one or two! mines to visit, the Adventure is one to pick. Not only are there extensive rock piles to collect on, but there is also a guided tour of part of the mine, a campground, picnic area, and rocks for sale. Collecting is good, ip an hour I picked up a double handfull of copper without my metal detector. It makes you wonder how any of these companies made any ,money when they left so much copper in the waste. I would rate this tour above that of the other underground tour in the area. They take you all the way through the mountain, you come out the other side half way up the mountain with a panoramic view of miles. You’ll get to see an old Indian mine, and will be pretty much free to explore all you want on the surface.</p>
<p>I’m going to skip over the mines at Winona, Atlantic, Trimountain, Painesdale, South Range, and Baltic. They are not much different from any others, except that most of them are under lease and posted. Ask locally, and stay away from operating concerns. Some copper sulfides are found at the Baltics.</p>
<p>There is a story that the Isle Royal mining company almost went broke on their namesake island before they came over to the peninsula and struck the lode. The mines are near the town of Dodgeville in the same general area as the Atlantics, etc. Look for boulders seamed with quartz. Splitting them open will sometimes reward you with pockets of crystals. Seams of calcite may contain analcite and natrolite, of course there’s copper, and this is a good locality for datolite and patricianite.</p>
<p>Try to ignore the mines between Hancock and Calumet, collecting on them is forbidden. If your willpower is weak take the road along the canal to McLain beach state park, or the road through Lake Linden. Either way will take you to Calumet, one way past some good scenery and the other way past the county historical society in Lake Linden. Then once you have your fill of copper you can come back on 26 past the famous Quincy Mines. The Historical Society has preserved the hoist from the Quincy No. 2 mine, along with some of the history of the Quincy company. You’d never believe it but Quincy Mining Company is still operating, even though they haven’t mined an ounce since 1945.</p>
<p>The reason:  they invested in a few blocks of property in a city called New York. That shaft below the dilapidated shafthouse next to the highway is over 9,000 feet deep and contributed to one of the most successful companies up there. Temperatures down there must have been over 100 degrees, they were running out of ore, and their equipment was at its limit. So they shut her down.</p>
<p>From Calumet on north the mines belong to the Calumet Division of Universal Oil Products. What’s an oil company doing in the copper mining business? Well, it sure made a nice tax write off when the strike shut them down. Officially you’re not supposed to collect on their land, but unofficially you’re free to collect as long as you stay away from the properties which still have buildings on them, whether they look abandoned or not.</p>

<p>The Laurium mine is one such “safe” collecting spot. Just south of Calumet on a little dirt road to a radio tower on the west side of the highway. The Laurium has just been rediscovered and is producing lots of crystalline copper, silver, epidote, calcite, and quartz. The minerals are easy to find, the little vugs are in almost every piece you pick up. The last time I was there it looked like a battlefield, with craters inside of craters. Don’t bother with a metal detector if you have one, it will just buzz continuously. The best way to find the good copper and silver is to find a spot in the area where everyone else has been digging, and go to work. I have had my best luck in holes at least two feet deep. There seems to be a layer of it down there somewhere. Why so much? The nearest anyone has been able to figure is that sometime after the mine closed a crew was sent in for some exploratory drifting, there was no processing equipment left, and so the material was just dumped. That seems to be the case, because the rich material seems to be much younger than that in the rest of the dump, which wouldn’t be the case if it were a stockpile from the operating mine.</p>
<p>Depressions and recessions hit these mines awfully hard and the project may then have been put off and forgotten. The copper of the Kearsarge lode for Calumet to Mohawk was mined through a total of 35 shafts by eight different companies. the names of the companies correspond to the names of the towns along the highway; Centennial, Kearsarge, Wolverine, Allouez, Ahmeek, Mohawk, and even Calumet.</p>
<p>Calumet is a boom town that survived the bust. Unlike so many Western towns that died with the mines, Calumet has survived. Take a drive through the town down the main street, then left a block and back in the direction you came. Look for the church at the south end of town, and the fire hall and opera house. These are massive red sandstone structures that do more than hint at the riches this town once saw. Turn right just past the “Centennial” sign to the Centennial No. 2 mine. Actually this is the location of the one and two shafts,but the number one has been covered for so long no one remembers where it is. On the rockpile you dan find the vesicle filling minerals such as epidote and quartz. Occasionally one finds datolite, and of course there’s copper.</p>
<p>If you (and your car) are adventurous, go out and look for the Kearsarge mines. Turn right on the Copper City road and right again past the gravel piles, (on the road, not the railroad) and from there you’re on your own. The Kearsarges are nothing special, so don’t feel too bad if you have to miss them. The Wolverine mines east of the Wolverine market are the same way as the Kearsarges and the Centennials. If you’ve seen one.</p>
<p>The Ahmeek mines are a different story. In a fissure vein between the number one and the number two shaft is a vein of mohawkite in milky white quartz. Called “spiderweb mohawkite” by those who cut cabs, these two were the only mines in the world who produced it. We’ve heard the same kind of story many times before: the stuff was no good as ore because of the arsenic content, so it was just piled underground. Some of it found its way onto the dumps and you might be lucky. The best pile to look at is the number one pile. At last word the number two pile was pretty well watched and still owned by C &amp; H. However things do change. It may now be owned by the same company that runs the factory there; Copper Country Homes. There’s no harm in asking there. The mines dumps by the three and four shafts aren’t very productive; most of the good stuff was hauled away several years ago for reprocessing and what’s left is extra barren. And as with all of the mines on the Kearsarge lode there is copper, silver, epidote, quartz, prehnite, and some datolite.</p>
<p>Massive mohawkjte is found on nearly all of the Mohawk thines. The piles are practically in town, east of the highway. The easiest way to get to Mohawk from the Ahmeeks is to keep on the road that goes by the factory. It will come back to the main highway before.</p>
<p>The last productive mine on the lode is the Seneca (or Gratiot) mine. It’s north, of Mohawk, on the right, just past the railroad crossing, and before the sawmill. This is another place where half of the treasure is in the scenery. From the top of the pile you can see Lake Superior a long way off. If you can keep your eyes on the ground you will find more massive mohawkite, copper, silver, prehnite, and maybe datolite, natrolite, analcite, calcite, and maybe even some barite.</p>
<p>There are mines on theleft side of the road between Calumet and here, and a few on the right which I haven’t mentioned. These mines, with their rockhouses still standing, are “conglomerate mines.” While those of the Kearsarge lode mine their copper from a layer of basalt, the copper in the conglomerate mines, as you might guess, comes in a conglomerate. Few crystalline minerals are found in these mines, but the ore itself makes an interesting specimen. Imagine a red or green conglomerate cemented together with copper. These mines are now being operated by Homestake Copper Company, and at last word they don’t allow collecting.</p>
<p>North of Seneca the character of the mines changes. Some of the oldest mines in the district are up here, and the first dividend-paying mine in the U.S., the Cliff mine, is one of them. These mines are grouped under the classification of fissure deposits. This means the ore was found as a fault zone filling, rather than within the beds as were the lodes. The fissure deposits were richer but less predictable, and by 1880 most of them were played out. Very few people know it but these deposits spurred the first mineral “rush” in the U.S. Four years before the Fortyniners started for California, groups of equally adventurous men headed for the Copper Country. Of course, there were no hostile Indians and no cross-continent wagon trips. Just a few weeks on a boat from Albany or Cleveland. But there were swamps, and mosquitoes, and cold winters.</p>
<p>Along with the character, the mineralogy of the deposits changes. Crystalline minerals become easier to find, and the crystals are bigger and better. Even the datolite is crystalline, and others which were mostly massive down south, such as laumontite, natrolite, analcite, calcite, and quartz, are well-crystalined up here. The mines themselves are harder to find and, the best directions I can give are “ask someone”. If you’re prepared for a little off-road travel, look for mines like the Copper Falls, Petherick, Delaware, Clark, and Mandan. The first two are good for minerals, and the last are notcd for their massive datolite.</p>
<p>And here are a few thoughts if you’re still looking for something to do: Eagle River, an old harbor and mining town. Look along the dunes south of the river for remains of the part of town that burned a century ago. Copper Harbor; another old town. Find your way to the Estivant pines, the last virgin forest in the area. Ft. Wilkins;  restoration of fort built to protect the Indians from the prospectors. Hungarian and Douglas Houghton Falls in Lake Linden are disappointments after a long dry spell, but swell after a rain and in the Spring. The Michigan Tech, mineral museum is currently closed for repairs, but a portion of it is exhibited on the second floor of the school’s lihrary.</p>
<p>I feel obliged, before I end, to add a few words of warning. Even though the mine inspector and road commission have done a thorough job in sealing all the old shafts, a few remain open deep in the woods, and a few easily accessible ones open up in the Spring. So watch out for leaf-filled depressions near old piles, and funnel shaped depressions anywhere. The Keweenaw County Sheriff is friendly with strangers, and if you’re nice to him he may let you out in the evenings to watch a little TV.</p>
<p>The Copper Country is an all-year affair. In the Winter when the snow covers the rocks, there is still some of the best snowmobiling and ski touring around, with miles of trails and abandoned railroad lines. The Spring is short, the Summer mild, and the Fall beautiful. And even if you don’t collect rocks, there is lots to do!</p>

<p>Going through a day wearing the jewelry will let you get familiar with how it hangs and whether or not it will be comfortable. You&#8217;ll also be able to get a better idea of the piece&#8217;s durability.</p>
<p>Men and women alike can get overwhelmed by jewelry at times, be it price, style, care or appropriate occasion. This article serves as a great guideline for jewelry selection, maintenance and ownership.</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry pieces looking beautiful by protecting them from tarnish. Try not to wear jewelry when you are around water. If you let some metals get wet too often, they can tarnish, rust or become dull. Clear nail polish, applied in a thin coat, can give jewelry some added protection.</p>

You might have inherited it or bought it on an impulse, but either way you probably need to look up some <a title="Handmade Jewelry Informationa" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/">information on jewelry</a>. The number of resources available can make things confusing at first. Find interesting information, and perhaps a few things you did not know, in the article ahead.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>

<p>When you go shopping for sterling silver jewelry pieces, take with you a magnet and a monocle. You can detect fake sterling silver with the magnet, since non-precious metals are drawn to magnets. Look for the hallmark stamped on the piece of jewelry to determine what percentage sterling silver it is. If you don&#8217;t see a stamp of any sort on a piece, then be wary of whether it is actually silver or not.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Do some research on the gem in your new piece of jewelry before you buy. Gems can be natural, imitation or synthetic.</small></div>
</div>
<p>If you are shopping unmarked sterling silver jewelry, then by all means bring a magnet. Precious metals, like sterling silver, will not be attracted to the magnet. Look for the hallmark stamped on the piece of jewelry to determine what percentage sterling silver it is. If your silver is not marked, it could be because it is not real!</p>
<p>Before you buy a gemstone, ask what type of gemstone it is. Jewels come in natural, synthetic and imitation forms. Synthetic stones are lab created jewels, while imitation stones are normally colored glass. Synthetic gems come from a lab and natural ones are found in the ground.</p>
<p>Be sure to at least inquire about the insurance that is available when you buy jewelry from a reputable jeweler. In the unfortunate, but possible event that your jewelry gets damaged, the jeweler will be able to replace or fix it for you. You might find some jewelers who are willing to insure it against loss and theft.</p>
<p>Jewelry should last for years to come. When you are shopping for your next piece, choose a reliable dealer. This can make all the difference in ensuring you get jewelry of the highest quality. Quality jewelry will be constructed to last, and show a fine attention to detail. Ask the jeweler what the origin of the piece is, like the maker and the origin of the stones. It is essential to purchase high-quality jewelry if you want it to become a treasured heirloom passed down for generations.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Discover whether they wear studs, hoop earrings, or some other type of jewelry. This is a great place to start when picking out that special item.</small></div>
</div>
<p>If you want to maintain the look of your jewelry, you should prevent it from becoming tarnished. Do not wear jewelery around water. Lots of jewelry materials are dulled or tarnished by water exposure. A very light coating of clear nail varnish can be applied to some jewelry, and this will add an additional line of protection against the elements.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<figure id="attachment_115" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.statement-jewelry.com/statement-jewelry-rings/blue-topaz-14k-gold-filled-cocktail-ring-marquise-cut.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-115 " title="Blue Topaz 14K Gold-filled Cocktail Ring - Marquise Cut" alt="Blue Topaz 14K Gold-filled Cocktail Ring - Marquise Cut" src="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14k_gold_filled_wire_wrapped_marquise_cut_blue_topaz_ring_-_side-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14k_gold_filled_wire_wrapped_marquise_cut_blue_topaz_ring_-_side-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14k_gold_filled_wire_wrapped_marquise_cut_blue_topaz_ring_-_side-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14k_gold_filled_wire_wrapped_marquise_cut_blue_topaz_ring_-_side-50x50.jpg 50w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/14k_gold_filled_wire_wrapped_marquise_cut_blue_topaz_ring_-_side.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Blue Topaz 14K Gold-filled Cocktail Ring &#8211; Marquise Cut</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s great that you love costume jewelry, but make sure you evaluate the condition of any piece you plan to buy. Collecting costume jewelry can get expensive, but it is also an investment worth your time, so avoid any pieces that have too many flaws. Investing in quality means that you can enjoy the jewelry for many years to come.</p>
<p>When buying a new piece of jewelry, be sure to check on the current fashion trends. If there is one thing better than a beautiful piece of jewelry, it&#8217;s finding that jewelry at a great price!</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Be sure to at least inquire about the insurance that is available when you buy jewelry from a reputable jeweler. Look for a good policy that lets you return damaged items.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Give the jewelry a little test drive and wear it for a little bit to see if it is comfortable and lays right. It will also allow you to see if the item is durable enough.</p>
<p>You need to pay special attention when caring for costume jewelry. Costume settings are often glued-in as compared to set-in. For this reason, costume jewelry should never touch water, and you should avoid using detergents on it. Use a damp cloth, then dry it with another clean, dry cloth. This method will keep your costume jewelry stunning and beautiful.</p>
<p>A brooch will accent your belt and will instantly add visual interest. Either put it near your hip or near the middle of your waist.</p>
<p>Wear jewelry for at least a day to see if it hangs correctly and is comfortable. You will be able to tell if it will hold up to wear and tear.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Taking good care of your jewelry is important if you want it to last. Different kinds of jewelery will require you take care of them in different ways.</small></div>
</div>
<p>When you are looking for new jewelry, the first thing to do is to check what is on sale. Finding a store offering extreme markdowns is a way to realize tremendous savings. Check for the best sales in the paper, online, and in store windows. Sometimes, you can save about half the original price on trendy pieces that aren&#8217;t as trendy anymore.</p>
<p>When getting presents for someone, you may want to consider purchasing sets of jewelry. Some stores give deals when sets of jewelry are purchased. Give away one piece at a time to different people throughout the years. This way, you know that you are giving a present that perfectly matches something the person already has.</p>
<p>Look for fancy robe hooks to hang your necklaces from so they do not become tangled. Organize these hooks in a row and use them to keep your necklaces free-hanging and untangled. You can group them by style, length or other criteria. This will keep them untangled, and it looks nice as well.</p>
<p>To maintain the shine and finish on your jewelry, do not put it on until you&#8217;ve done your hair and makeup. Any kind of spare dust or oil will attach itself to your jewelry, so putting it on before makeup will just make it look a little dirty. In particular, this hint is aimed towards your necklaces and earrings.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Buy jewelry on sale whenever possible. Buying at the right moment can mean big savings.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Jewelry has many different and interesting aspects. However, if you conduct your research properly, you can ensure that the pieces you purchase are of the highest quality, and that the way you care for them will keep them beautiful for many years to come. Welcome to the exciting, and always changing, world of jewelry. These tips can help you start your journey armed with knowledge.</p>

<p>If you are in the market to buy some silver jewelry, don&#8217;t forget to take a magnet along with you. By using the magnet you can quickly determine if the jewelry item is made of a cheaper metal and not sterling silver. If your silver is sterling, you will also notice a mark on the piece. This mark might state .925, sterling, or ster. If you don&#8217;t see such a mark, you might want to reconsider the purchase. This is usually an indication that the piece is fake.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Do some research on the gem in your new piece of jewelry before you buy. The types of gems available are synthetic, imitation and natural.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Before you buy a gemstone, ask what type of gemstone it is. Three different kinds of gems are available for purchase: imitation, synthetic and natural. Natural and synthetic gems are real stones, but imitation is just plastic colored to look like the real thing. Natural gemstones are mined, while synthetic gems are artificially grown.</p>
<p>Good jewelry will last a lifetime. When buying jewelry, only buy from dealers with good reputations, so that you don&#8217;t buy a piece that seems durable, but really isn&#8217;t. Jewelry should display exemplary craftsmanship and be well-made. The jeweler ought to know the history of the piece, such as its manufacturer and the source of the gemstones. If you select high-quality jewelry, it will last you forever.</p>
<p>Do some price comparisons before you commit to buying a piece of diamond jewelry. Start by finding what you like, and then begin comparing it with other pieces. You must be a sharp consumer to avoid tricks that might make a diamond look better than it really is.</p>
<p>When shopping for a diamond, it&#8217;s crucial that you do comparisons. Look at what you like close up, and compare them to other pieces you have seen. Be aware that some dealers will use cheap tactics to make a diamond look better than it is.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> The stone is an important part of a piece of jewelry so should be considered carefully. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Pay attention if they usually wear studs or hoop earrings, white gold or yellow, and any other typical jewelry that they wear. Doing this will provide a good basis for where you should begin so that you can purchase a special piece for that special someone.</p>

<p>Avoid using harmful substances like bleach, ammonia, acetone, turpentine and the like to clean them. This can cause your stones to turn and dull in color, along with eating away any enamel on the pieces.</p>
<p>Get a polishing cloth for your jewelery. This is a fairly simple way to achieve shine without dealing with solvents and chemicals. You can use the two-sided cloth to polish your jewelry in the same way you would polish a drinking glass. First, use the polishing side to polish it up, then use the other side to shine it.</p>

</div>
<p>If you want to buy sterling silver pieces, use a magnet and examine the jewelry very carefully. Magnets attract non-precious metals, and you can use this fact to detect fakes. Your sterling silver jewelery should always be imprinted if it is real. The stamp may read &#8220;.925&#8221; or &#8220;ster&#8221;. Be wary of pieces that lack any silver hallmarks, as this is an indication that they&#8217;re not genuine sterling silver.</p>
<p>Before you think about picking up new jewelry, check into what the latest trends are to get a sense of what&#8217;s of value. Getting a nice piece of jewelry is good, but getting it at a discount is even better.</p>
<p>When purchasing jewelry from a respected jeweler, inquire as to whether they offer an insurance policy. Many stores offer a policy where you can bring broken or damaged jewelry back to the original jeweler for repair at little to no cost. In certain instances, there may even be jewelry insurance available to cover loss or theft.</p>

<p>When purchasing sterling silver, take along a good magnifying glass, along with a small magnet. If the piece you are examining is not silver and is made from non-precious metal, it will be attracted to the magnet. There should be a stamp hallmarked that says something like .925 sterling or ster, on sterling silver If the piece that you are looking at is not hallmarked, this is usually the sign that it is a fake.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Pay attention to the types, sizes, and colors of jewelry that the person wears. Doing this will provide a good basis for where you should begin so that you can purchase a special piece for that special someone.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Keep your jewelry free of tarnish to make it look its best. Never wear your jewelry when you are going to be near water. Water can cause some metals to lose their luster or to become tarnished or rusty. A very light coating of clear nail varnish can be applied to some jewelry, and this will add an additional line of protection against the elements.</p>
<p>Consider stones when you are buying jewelry. Choose pieces that have stones which express your personality and those that make you feel great when you wear them. Neutral colored stones go well with many different outfits. Buying a stone that you will never wear is pointless</p>
<p>You should always make an effort to properly care for all of your jewelry. There&#8217;s an ideal way to clean every different type of setting and stone. Along the same lines, enhancing different stones and settings requires you to take different steps. Go ahead and ask a professional jeweler to find out exactly how you should be caring for your jewels.</p>
<p>Before committing yourself to a piece, do research to determine which styles are hot and which are not. Getting a nice piece of jewelry is good, but getting it at a discount is even better.</p>
<p>Consider unique pieces of jewelry for unique individuals. Show your affection for the person by recognizing their unique qualities; put some thought into the purchase and be creative.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for jewelry, always seek out sales. If you find the right sale, you might see a lot of savings. Look for the best promotions and sales on the Internet, in your local paper, on television ads, and even in storefront windows. Purchasing a piece of jewelry that is recently out of style can save you nearly half of what you would have paid originally.</p>
<p>When you list jewelry for sale online, make sure you present it in the best possible way. Handling jewelry often helps the customer make up his mind but this is not possible with online transactions. Take professional-looking pictures of your pieces and let people know you can send more pictures upon request.</p>
<p>If you want to collect costume jewelry, concentrate on getting quality peices. Costume jewelry is pricey and can retain its value in many cases, but pieces that are damaged aren&#8217;t worth much and aren&#8217;t worth the time to restore. A good piece will give you many years of happiness and even gain value over time.</p>

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> The color gemstones are an important consideration when shopping for new jewelry. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color.</small></div>

<p>Use a polishing cloth for all of your jewelry pieces. This is an easy way to get shine without chemicals and solvents. To clean your jewelry, obtain a soft two-sided cloth and gently rub in a circular motion. Use the side of the cloth that is designed for polishing to remove fingerprints, dust and other surface imperfections, and then use the opposite side to buff the jewelry and make it gleam.</p>
<p>Be careful when storing all your jewelry together. It is best to use holders, compartments, boxes, and hooks so that everything is kept separate. Do not just throw them into piles in a box. This not only harms the fragile pieces, but it can also cause items, such as necklaces, to get badly tangled up with the other pieces of jewelry.</p>

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Do your research before settling on one diamond. Take a look at the diamonds up close, then put it next to other pieces you are interested in.</small></div>
</div>
<p>When shopping for sterling silver jewelry, it is a good idea to bring a small magnet along with you. As a precious metal, silver should never be attracted to a magnet. You will always find a hallmark stamp such as &#8220;.925&#8221; or &#8220;STER.&#8221; on genuine sterling, or alternately, it might simply say, &#8220;STERLING&#8221;. If a particular piece is not stamped, you should be cautious of its authenticity.</p>
<p>Before you buy anything new, found out about the latest trend. The only thing that beats getting a new piece of jewelry is getting it for a discounted price!</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Notice what type of earrings they are wearing, including the shape and metal. This way, you know where you should start when buying a gift.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Consider stones when you are buying jewelry. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color.</small></div>

<p>Special care is required for costume or <a title="Jewelry Care Tips and Information" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/">handmade jewelry</a>. Many of the components of costume jewelry are glued into their settings rather than held in with prongs or other more permanent methods. Take care not to use chemicals or lots of water in an attempt to clean your costume jewelry. The best way to care for your jewelry is to use one damp cloth to wipe it followed by a dry one to dry it. This helps keep costume jewelry looking sparkling clean and new.</p>
<p>Esoteric people like to have handcrafted specialty pieces for presents. An item that highlights their personality indicates that you put time and effort into the purchase, which is what you should convey when giving jewelry to someone.</p>
<p>A brooch will add an interesting aspect to the belt. Pin the brooch on your belt in the center, or offset to one side.</p>

<p>Costume jewelry needs to be handled and stored delicately. Many of the components of costume jewelry are glued into their settings rather than held in with prongs or other more permanent methods. Don&#8217;t immerse costume jewelry in water or use chemicals on it. To properly care for it you need to use a cloth dampened with warm water. After wiping make sure to use another cloth to thoroughly dry it. This helps keep costume jewelry looking sparkling clean and new.</p>
<h2>Baby Oil</h2>
<p>Learn how to unravel a knotted necklace, even one with delicate loops. If you are about to give up, get some baby oil and plastic wrap. After placing the necklace on the wrap, coat it with mineral or baby oil. Untangle it with the use of a needle. Wash them using dish soap, and then pat dry them.</p>
<p>Know what you want to do with jewelry prior to purchasing it. There is no point in filling your jewelery box with things you cannot wear. When choosing a piece of jewelry, take into account what you will be wearing it with.</p>
<p>When you are looking for new jewelry, the first thing to do is to check what is on sale. With the right kind of sale, you can save a lot of money. You can snag a sweet sale by perusing your neighborhood shops, checking the classified ads, or even going online. Buying styles that are going out of fashion can be a huge money saver, even getting up to 50% off.</p>

The below article will provide you some very useful tips for maximizing the value from your effort and money that is put into purchasing jewelry.</p>
<p>Be careful on how you store all of your jewelry together. You should keep the pieces separate in compartments, boxes, holders, and on hooks for better storage. Resist the urge to jumble all your pieces together in one box or basket. Not only will your necklaces become hopelessly tangled, you risk harming any fragile pieces as they bump and scrape against each other as you search the box.</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry stored somewhere that is free from humidity or air. To ensure it is protected, keep your jewelry in a drawstring bag or a jewelry box that is closed. Humidity and air tends to cause precious and non-precious metals to tarnish. Precious metals can easily be polished, but non-precious metal needs a special polish.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<figure id="attachment_130" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.statement-jewelry.com/statement-jewelry-cuffs/sterling-silver-anticlastic-cuff.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-130 " title="Sterling Silver Anticlastic Cuff" alt="Sterling Silver Anticlastic Cuff" src="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sterling_silver_anticlastic_cuff_bracelet_1-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sterling_silver_anticlastic_cuff_bracelet_1-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sterling_silver_anticlastic_cuff_bracelet_1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sterling_silver_anticlastic_cuff_bracelet_1-50x50.jpg 50w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sterling_silver_anticlastic_cuff_bracelet_1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sterling Silver Anticlastic Cuff</figcaption></figure>
<p>Keep your jewelry stored somewhere that is free from humidity or air. It&#8217;s best to store it in a closed box, like a jewelry box, or a drawstring bag. Tarnish is a chemical reaction that happens when silver and other metals are exposed to moisture and air. Precious metals can often be polished to remove most tarnish. Non-precious metals often have a single coat of metal. Therefore, polishing them can remove the coat and show the copper that is found underneath.</p>
<p>Compare lots of diamonds before you settle on one to buy. Take a look at the diamonds up close, then put it next to other pieces you are interested in. Beware, there are many tricks to enhance the look of a sub-par diamond.</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry free of tarnish to make it look its best. Don&#8217;t wear jewelry near water. A lot of metals will rust, tarnish or dull when they come in contact with water. Apply clear nail polish to your jewelery as an added protection.</p>
<p>See what types of earrings they wear, what color, if they wear ankle bracelets, etc. This way, you know where you should start when buying a gift.</p>
<h2>Collecting Costume Jewelry</h2>
<figure id="attachment_131" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://copperjewelry4u.tumblr.com/post/54770742268/blue-patinated-drop-copper-earrings-are-you"><img class="size-medium wp-image-131 " title="Blue Patinated Drop Copper Earrings" alt="Blue Patinated Drop Copper Earrings" src="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mp9x5zRg3d1sqxysao1_500-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mp9x5zRg3d1sqxysao1_500-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mp9x5zRg3d1sqxysao1_500-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mp9x5zRg3d1sqxysao1_500-50x50.jpg 50w, http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mp9x5zRg3d1sqxysao1_500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Blue Patinated Drop Copper Earrings</figcaption></figure>
<p>When collecting costume jewelry, pay close attention to the condition of any piece you are considering. Collecting costume jewelry can get expensive, but it is also an investment worth your time, so avoid any pieces that have too many flaws. Compare pieces for quality, because good ones stay high or even grow in value over time.</p>
<p>You need to take special care of costume jewelry. A fair amount of costume pieces are set with glue. Do not dip your jewelery in chemicals that may harm them. The best way to maintain your costume jewelry is to use a moist, warm cloth first, then dry it off with another cloth. This will keep any costume jewelry that you have looking great.</p>
<p>Having an ornate piece at your waist will naturally draw eyes by adding interest. Try pinning it at the center of your waist or near your hip.</p>
<p>Buying jewelry is better if you keep watch for sales. The right sale can save you a ton of money. Scope out the sales in every store you can find. Purchasing a piece of jewelry that is recently out of style can save you nearly half of what you would have paid originally.</p>
<p>Have a purpose in mind before shopping for jewelry. There is no need for a box of unused jewelry. Take a look in your closet and consider what outfits your jewelry will accessorize.</p>
<p>Find out if your gemstone was treated before you buy it and if it was, how it was treated. Different treatments come with different requirements for cleaning and storage. If you use the wrong cleanser because you are uneducated about the gem, you could strip off the treatment and even damage the stone.</p>
<p>More desirable than a big piece is the cut and clarity of the diamond. Also, bear in mind the style of the intended recipient.</p>
<p>That includes dry or steam saunas. The high temperatures and damp environment can corrode the surface of your jewelry and cause long-term damage to the piece.</p>
<p>Hit up several different stores when looking for diamond jewelry. No diamond is the same and each has subtle imperfections. Once you see some of the flaws in person, they may become less important. When it comes to flaws, each jeweler prices diamonds a bit differently. You can make the most of your investment if you take the time to comparison shop and hunt down the best diamond that falls within your price range.</p>
<p>More desirable than a big piece is the cut and clarity of the diamond. Keep the individual you are buying the diamond for in mind.</p>

<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> The prices for diamonds vary greatly so shop around before making a purchase. Every diamond is unique, and there will always be tiny flaws.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Jewelry that is taken care of is extremely valuable both in monetary worth and sentimental value. By learning what you need to do to properly care for your jewelry, you are working to protect memories and the money invested in it. As you learn more about jewelry, you will be able to protect your jewelry even better.</p>

It may not always seem feasible to incorporate the plethora of information that&#8217;s out there. Luckily, all the hottest tips are in this one article.</p>
<p>Store your jewelry in a place that is not subjected to humidity extremes or open air. Some good examples of proper storage would be,a jewelry box that is closed, or a small draw string bag. Air and humidity can cause the metals that the jewelry are made of to tarnish. It&#8217;s possible to restore precious metals through polishing, but lesser-quality metals may suffer permanent damage.</p>
<p>Jewelry should last a life-time. When selecting jewelry, a reputable jeweler is indispensable to ensuring you get quality items. High quality jewelry is well-crafted and made of exceptional materials. The jeweler will be able to provide a complete history of the piece of jewelry, including who made it, and exactly where the stones originated. When you choose a piece of jewelry that is high in quality, it can become a heirloom that will last forever.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>
<p>Having a good eye to catch the details, and a magnet, are key when you are considering the purchase of any type of sterling silver jewelry. Precious metals, like sterling silver, will not be attracted to the magnet. You can recognize sterling silver by stamps that say &#8216;.925&#8217; or &#8216;ster&#8217;. If there is no marking on the piece, it may not be sterling silver.</p>
<p>Always be aware of the type of stone you&#8217;re buying when dealing with gems. A stone may be natural, synthetic or imitation. Natural and synthetic gems are real stones, but imitation is just plastic colored to look like the real thing. Synthetic gems are grown in a lab, natural gems are dug out of the Earth.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain the look of your jewelry, you should prevent it from becoming tarnished. Avoid wearing your jewelry near water. Metals will often tarnish or rust when in contact with water. Applying a very thin covering of clear nail varnish to your jewelry offers an added degree of protection.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Put the jewelry on and wear it for a bit so you can describe the comfort and fit. In this way, you will be able to tell if the item will withstand normal wear.</small></div>
</div>
<p>When you are buying new jewelery, think about the stones you want to get. Choose pieces that have stones which express your personality and those that make you feel great when you wear them. Neutral colors work better to match all your clothing. There is no point in buying something that is not functional.</p>
<p>When you are buying jewelery for someone who is very different or eccentric, try going to a jeweler that will make you a piece that will fit their personality and add to their flair! This means you have taken the time to think about the gift and make it as personal as possible. Customized jewelery will also help you convey the right message.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a gemstone, find out if it has been treated, and if so, how. The various treatments that gems are given means that they need to be cared for differently. If you use the wrong cleanser because you are uneducated about the gem, you could strip off the treatment and even damage the stone.</p>
<p>If the person you are shopping for is a unique individual, consider choosing a one-of-a-kind piece crafted specifically for them. This will express the time you spent to get their gift just right, just the kind of sentiment you want to show your special friends.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> An attractive brooch can increase visual interest and accent your waist. Pin the brooch on your belt in the center, or offset to one side.</small></div>
</div>
<p>It is critical that the photos and descriptions you use to sell jewelry online are attractive and high-quality. Visuals are particularly important because customers cannot physically see or touch jewelery when they buy online. Make sure that the pictures focus specifically on the piece of jewelry with a background that enhances its beauty.</p>
<p>A jewelry set makes an excellent present for that special someone. It is not uncommon for jewelers to offer special discounts on matched sets. You can divide up the set into individual pieces and give them out one at a time. You will always have presents ready for your loved ones, even if you did not plan in advance.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going swimming, make sure you take off your jewelery first. The chlorine in pool water is very harsh and may cause your fine jewelry to appear dull. Salt water is just as bad as chlorinated water. To extend the life of your jewelry, and protect the beauty, take off all jewelry before going into the water.</p>
<p>Your jewelry will stay cleaner if you wait until after you apply make-up to put it on. The dust, oils and particles from makeup rub off on jewelry; putting on jewels first means they will get dingy and dull with a film of makeup over them. It is especially important to follow this tip for necklaces and earrings.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Before purchasing a gemstone, find out if it has been treated, and if so, how. Different treatments come with different requirements for cleaning and storage.</small></div>
</div>
<p>To keep your necklaces tangle-free, look for pretty, embellished robe hooks. They can be hung anywhere, like a closet door, and give you the ability to organize your necklaces by size or color if you want. This will keep you from having to worry about tangled necklaces the next time you go for one, and it happens to also be an attractive way to display them.</p>
<h2>Gold Jewelry</h2>
<p>These days of sky-high gold prices makes <a title="Gold Jewelry Buying Tips" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/category/gold-jewelry/" target="_blank">buying gold jewelry</a> an expensive proposition. However, you can still have a nice piece of gold jewelry at a lower price if you opt for lower karats. A piece of jewelry that is 75% gold is said to have 18 karats, which is high quality but still affordable; a good combination.</p>
<p>Untangle your knotted messes of delicate chains and necklaces. Don&#8217;t give up on getting the knots out, instead get a sheet of plastic wrap. Put the necklace on the plastic wrap and cover it with a little baby oil. If the jewelry is tangled and knotted, try using needles to unknot the strands. When your necklaces are straight, use dish soap to wash the oil off and pat them dry.</p>
<p>Onyx and crystal can be wonderful jewelry options. By being nicer to your wallet, you may get better results.</p>
<p>One stone that is often forgotten about is Alexandrite, although it looks beautiful when made into a piece of jewelry. The stone&#8217;s color morphs from green to purple, changing based on whether you are inside a building or standing outside. Alexandrite is usually found in earrings, rings or pendants.</p>
<p>Giving jewelery, or wearing it with style, is a matter of being properly educated. This article could save you both time and money. You can use the advice you have read in this article to help you achieve success with jewelry.</p>
<p>Jewelry sets make excellent gifts for loved ones. Some stores give deals when sets of jewelry are purchased. Consider splitting apart the set and giving your loved one a single piece at a time. It&#8217;s a good way to ascertain that you are never without a great gift to give a loved one.</p>

Are you able to recognize authentic, high quality jewelry? Are you knowledgeable about the different types of jewelry? This article is entirely devoted to all things jewelry. For example, you can learn how to enhance your appearance with jewelry, how to clean jewelry, how to store jewelry, and host of other valuable tips.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the type of metal they wear, such as white gold or yellow gold. Also notice if your loved one usually wears hoops or studs. By doing this you should have a good idea what to buy them.</p>
<p>Ensure you are certain how to keep your jewelery in one place so it is not damaged. Precious metals and certain gemstones will tarnish if they are exposed to humidity, so keep the away from this. Don&#8217;t just toss your jewelry in a pile. Storing them improperly can damage the fragile pieces, and necklaces can get tangled with other pieces.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> When you are shopping, think about the color or type of gem you want to buy. A stone may be natural, synthetic or imitation.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Make sure you take precautions to stop your jewelery from losing its shine. Keep your jewelry away from water. Many of the metals become tarnished, rusty or dull when they get exposed to the elements of water. To protect your jewelry from exposure, apply a single coat of clear nail lacquer to its surface.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>If you are wanting to collect costume jewelry, you should ensure you are aware of its condition. Costume jewelry can prove to be a good investment, but also a costly one; keep in mind the pieces you wish to add to your collection don&#8217;t show too much wear. A piece in good condition will be much more resourceful to you in the future.</p>
<p>Good jewelry will last a lifetime. When choosing your next piece of jewelry, be sure to deal with a reputable dealer to ensure you attain a high-quality piece. <a title="Beneficial Tips To Help With Your Jewlery Needs" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/beneficial-tips-to-help-with-your-jewlery-needs/" target="_blank">High-quality jewelry is durable</a> and displays excellent craftsmanship. Make sure the jeweler is able to tell you the history of the piece, including who created it and where any stones come from. You need to buy quality jewelry so that you can pass it down as an heirloom.</p>
<p>Try wearing the item for a little while to see if it is comfortable and hangs correctly. It will also allow you to see if it can withstand every day wear and tear.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re shopping for an individual who likes unique pieces of jewelry, you should consider purchasing an item that is made specifically for this person. You want the piece to match the person; unique people deserve unique jewelry.</p>
<p>In order to make sure your jewelry is always looking clean, you should only put a piece on once you&#8217;ve applied your make-up. Dirt and oil accumulate in the small crevices of jewelry, and can make it look dull and shabby. This tip especially applies to necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>Wear jewelry for at least a day to see if it hangs correctly and is comfortable. Doing this also tells you how well it stands up to normal daily wear.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Costume jewelry needs to be handled carefully. Often, stones will be glued into their settings, which makes them more prone to falling out than regular jewelry.</small></div>
</div>
<p>When you are interested in buying some jewelery you should expect to find good sales. You can save huge amounts of money if you are savvy. Sales can be found online, in store windows, or in your local newspaper. Buying styles that are going out of fashion can be a huge money saver, even getting up to 50% off.</p>
<p>Untangling knotted chains can be easy if you know how to do it. Believe it or not, you can use plastic wrap to untangle jewelry. Place the tangled pieces on this plastic with some mineral or baby oil. Try using needles to start untangling it. Finally, use dish soap and dry gently with a towel.</p>
<p>If you are looking to sell jewelry online, ensure that the photos you use make the piece look attractive. This is very important because a customer cannot look at the jewelery if they are buying it online. Ensure the focus of your pictures is the piece itself.</p>
<p>A brooch can add visual interest and an accent to an otherwise dull belt. You can pin in at the front-center of the belt or near the hip.</p>
<p>More desirable than a big piece is the cut and clarity of the diamond. The intended recipient&#8217;s personality should play a role in diamond selection, too.</p>
<p>Remember these tips when you buy jewelry or choose what you are going to wear with your outfit. You might find yourself making more stylish jewelry selections, or even saving big money by recognizing good deals. Anyone can acquire a better taste in jewelry with time and efforts.</p>

Given that there is a diverse array of jewelry on the market, and each involves special tips for care and wearing, it is helpful to have a bit of information. The following article is designed to provide you with answers to some of the questions you may have about jewelry.</p>
<p>Get a polishing cloth for your jewelery. You can keep your items shiny without using chemicals. Buff your jewelry with the two-sided cloth, just as if you were cleaning a glass. Use one side of the cloth for polishing, and reserve the other side for shining it afterward.</p>
<p>Try using a simple polishing cloth on your jewelery collection. It will allow you to make your jewelry look as good as new without the use of chemicals.

<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Take a moment to consider how your valuable jewelry is stored and sorted. Precious metals and certain gemstones will tarnish if they are exposed to humidity, so keep the away from this.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Avoid using things like bleach, acetone, ammonia, turpentine, and other related chemicals to clean them with. This will result in damage to both the stones and the metal of the piece.</p>
<p>Be careful on how you store all of your jewelry together. It is better to use boxes, compartments, holders, and hooks for keeping pieces separate. Do not ever just throw them in a pile. Fragile jewelry could easily be damaged by doing this, not to mention the nuisance of having to untangle necklace chains that could get caught together.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Bring a magnet when shopping for sterling silver jewelery. To spot scams, see if the magnet attracts the piece. If it does, then shout &#8220;FAKE!&#8221; at the top of your lungs and move to the next store. You can identify sterling silver by its markings, for example &#8220;sterling,&#8221; &#8220;ster,&#8221; or &#8220;.925.&#8221; If there is no hallmark, the piece is probably not authentic and may, indeed, be counterfeit.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Know which kind of stone you are buying with your jewelry. The three types are imitation, synthetic and natural.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Be sure that you store all of your jewelry safely away from air and humidity. Store them in a closed jewelry box or small drawstring bag for maximum protection. When non-precious and precious metals are expose to air and humidity, they tend to tarnish. It is possible to polish precious metals, but polishing non-precious metals will damage the coating, which makes the copper that metal was covering show.</p>
<p>Make sure you know what kind of gem you are getting when you are buying jewelry. There are basically three distinct types: natural gems, synthetic gems and imitation stones. Imitation is plastic that is colored to looked like the stone, but <a title="Information on Gemstone Jewelry" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/category/gemstone-jewelry/">natural stones</a> and synthetic stones are real. Natural stones are dug up out of the ground and synthetic ones are grown in a lab.</p>
<p>Jewelry can be very overwhelming, it is necessary to consider pricing, style, and care. This article contains lots of advice to help answer all of your jewelry questions.</p>
<p>Jewelry is something that can last generations. When choosing your next piece of jewelry, be sure to deal with a reputable dealer to ensure you attain a high-quality piece. Any piece that is high quality will have its craftsmanship and quality shining through. The jeweler you buy it from should be providing you with a provenance on the piece. Details of where it came from, what it is made from and who made it. Investing in a high-quality jewelry piece ensures that you will have a timeless item that will be just as wearable in 20 years as it is today.</p>

These policies dictate whether or not the jeweler will replace or fix your item of jewelry if it is damaged. There are even some jewelers that will cover the replacement if the piece has been lost or stolen.</p>
<p>If you can prevent your jewelry from tarnishing, it will surely look much more attractive. Exposure to water can affect the finish, so avoid it. Metals will often tarnish or rust when in contact with water. If you are looking to protect your jewelry from the ill effects of water, try applying clear nail polish, just a thin layer, on the piece itself.</p>
<p>Do your research before settling on one diamond. Always see the piece up close, and compare it critically to any others you&#8217;re considering. With diamonds, you need to have a keen eye because of the many tricks people will use to enhance it.</p>
<p>You could wear it for a day to make sure it is not uncomfortable. You will also find out if your creation is durable enough.</p>
<p>If you are buying jewelry for someone who values her individuality, find a one-of-a-kind piece or commission a piece designed specifically for her. Pieces that match their personality will highlight your thoughtfulness and creativity, especially since you care for them enough to purchase jewelry for them.</p>
<p>A brooch will add an interesting aspect to the belt. Pin the brooch on your belt in the center, or offset to one side.</p>
<p>Ask about a jeweler&#8217;s insurance policy before buying anything. Then, if something actually happens to the jewelry, you can return it or have it repaired. Many jewelers also have insurance for lost or stolen pieces.</p>

<p>Jewelry that has been cared for well over the years has higher value than jewelry that has not. You can protect your jewelry by understanding how to care for your jewelry.

Jewelry can bring back memories of an important event or occasion and provides a way for people to show how much they care about each other. By knowing more about jewelry, and the buying and selling process in particular, you will find the purchase of each piece a rewarding and memorable experience.</p>
<p>Arm yourself with a magnet and a magnifying glass when shopping for sterling silver jewelry. To spot scams, see if the magnet attracts the piece. If it does, then shout &#8220;FAKE!&#8221; at the top of your lungs and move to the next store. Sterling silver always has some sort of stamp to indicate it is sterling. If a particular piece is not stamped, you should be cautious of its authenticity.</p>
<p>Separate your jewelry for storage to avoid getting pieces tangled. It&#8217;s better to keep pieces separate by using boxes, holders, hooks and other containers. Avoid simply piling them on top of each other in a box. This not only harms the fragile pieces, but it can also cause items, such as necklaces, to get badly tangled up with the other pieces of jewelry.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Know which kind of stone you are buying with your jewelry. There are three different types: natural, synthetic and imitation.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Good jewelry will last a lifetime. When you look for a piece of jewelry, always use a dealer with a good reputation, ensuring that the piece you choose is of high-quality. The best jewelry is well-designed and well-made with close attention to detail. A good jeweler can provide you with some background on the piece, such as who crafted it, where it was manufactured, and where any stones in it came from. Put effort into your choice, so you can be sure that the piece will last generations.</p>
<p>When you purchase jewelry from a jeweler, ask about their insurance policy. These policies dictate whether or not the jeweler will replace or fix your item of jewelry if it is damaged. There are some jewelers that will also have insurance plans for pieces that get lost or stolen.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Have shopping companions when you shop for diamonds. Take a very close look at the piece you like, and then make the comparison to any others on your favorites list. Beware, there are many tricks to enhance the look of a sub-par diamond.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> What color gold do they seem to favor &#8211; white or yellow? Do they normally wear a bracelet? What type of earrings do they prefer &#8211; drop and dangle or studs? Take a mental note of this important information. This will help you get started in your search for the perfect item of jewelry for your loved one.</small></div>
</div>
<p>If you like to buy <a title="Get More Mileage Out Of Your Jewelry With These Helpful Tips" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/get-more-mileage-out-of-your-jewelry-with-these-helpful-tips/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a>, make sure that you examine the condition carefully. Costume jewelry can be very expensive and a great investment, but a piece that shows too much wear and tear will not be worth the money or time. Costume pieces kept in great condition will enhance your collection much more over time.</p>
<p>Test it out by wearing it yourself; you don&#8217;t want to give a piece that will be uncomfortable or awkward for the recipient. You will also have the knowledge that the piece is not going to fall apart the first time the receiver wears it.</p>
<p>Think about how best ways to look after your jewelry. Not all types of jewelry can be cleaned in the same manner. What works for a certain kind of stone may not work for another. If you can&#8217;t find proper treatment methods, try consulting with a professional jeweler.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trends in jewelry before you pick up a new piece. It is one thing to get a gorgeous bauble, but it is another to get it on sale!</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Ask about a jeweler&#8217;s insurance policy before buying anything. Then, you will have peace of mind knowing it can be fixed or replaced if anything happens.</small></div>
</div>
<p>If you are buying jewelry for someone who values her individuality, find a one-of-a-kind piece or commission a piece designed specifically for her. A unique piece like this that matches their personality appears creative and thoughtful, and it shows them that you care about them enough to buy them something that they&#8217;ll wear.</p>
<p>Putting on jewelry only after you have put on makeup and fixed your hair will keep it from being exposed to chemicals that could tarnish it. The grime and dust in makeup are attracted to the jewelry, and if you put on the jewelry before the cosmetics, it can cause the pieces to look dull. Earrings and necklaces are especially prone to this kind of contamination.</p>
<p>Ask your jeweler before you make a purchse about what kinds of treatments were used on the gemstones in the piece. You will have to treat different gemstones with different kinds of care. For example, you would not want to use a jewelry cleaner that is incompatible with a certain type of treatment. Doing so could result in irreversible damages to the color and surface of the stone.</p>
<p>You should wear the jewelry for a few days to see how it feels and if it is comfortable. You will also find out if your creation is durable enough.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Think about ordering custom jewelery if you want to make an original gift to someone who counts for you. An item that highlights their personality indicates that you put time and effort into the purchase, which is what you should convey when giving jewelry to someone.</small></div>
</div>
<p>When you are looking for new jewelry, the first thing to do is to check what is on sale. Buying at the right moment can mean big savings. Scope out the sales in every store you can find. Sometimes, you can save about half the original price on trendy pieces that aren&#8217;t as trendy anymore.</p>
<p>Buying, selling or owning jewelry, involves investing in something almost priceless, which is the memory itself. Every piece of jewelry has its own story, whether it reminds you of a special time in your life, or represents an important part of your personality.</p>

You can make sure that the time and money you devote to your jewelry does not go to waste by reading this article&#8217;s tips.</p>
<p>Jewelry should be stored in an air-tight and humid free area. It&#8217;s best to store it in a closed box, like a jewelry box, or a drawstring bag. Continued exposure to humidity extremes or air causes metals typically used in jewelry to tarnish. Silver polishes work well to remove tarnish, but certain metals, such as bronze, may not polish well. The polish may remove the surface coating and then the metal underneath, such as copper, becomes visible.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth for all of your jewelry pieces. A polishing cloth is a very gentle way to get a good shine on all your pieces. Use the dual-sided cloth on your jewelry just as you would clean a glass. Use the polishing side first and, then the other side to make your jewelry shine.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> When you go diamond shopping, make sure that you do shopping comparisons. Take a look at the diamonds up close, then put it next to other pieces you are interested in.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Have shopping companions when you shop for diamonds. Look at what you want very closely, and keep that in mind so you can compare it with other diamonds you look at. You must be a sharp consumer to avoid tricks that might make a diamond look better than it really is.</p>
<p>Before buying a new item of jewelry, do a little research on recent trends. Price a variety of similar items before buying an expensive piece.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Make sure a piece of jewelry is still in style before you buy it. The only thing that can make picking out a fantastic piece of jewelry better is if you get it at a discount.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> When shopping for jewelry, think about the stones in the pieces. The gemstone you choose should work with your skin tone and suit your personality.</small></div>
</div>
<p>You should ensure the quality of the pieces of <a title="A Simple Jewelry Guide" href="http://www.bronze-jewelry.com/a-simple-jewelry-guide/">costume jewelry</a> that you purchase for your collection. Well-done costume jewelry is often worth the price, but if it&#8217;s worn out or visibly damaged, it won&#8217;t be worth the effort it takes to restore it. A piece in good condition will be much more resourceful to you in the future.</p>
<p>If you wear the piece for 24 hours, then you can be sure that it has been put together correctly and hangs nicely. This also helps you to see its durability.</p>
<p>You will need to take special care when you are buying costume jewelery! Many of the costume type settings are glued-in, rather than set-in. Don&#8217;t submerge costume jewelry in water or clean it with abrasives. To clean your jewelry, dampen a cloth with warm water and gently wipe the item. Then use a clean, dry cloth to dry the jewelry. This will help your costume jewelry to continue looking great.</p>
<p>You should carefully consider how to best care for your jewelry. Different cleaning techniques are required for different types of jewelry. A treatment that polishes one stone may scratch another stone. Talk with a professional if you aren&#8217;t sure what sort of care each jewel requires.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
<div style="background-color: #ffffcc; color: #000000;"><small><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>TIP!</b></span> Costume jewelry has different, specific care requirements. Many of the stones and embellishments are just glued in instead of set in a professional setting.</small></div>
</div>
<p>Put your make up on before the jewelery. The small particles of powdered makeup can easily dull the shine of your jewelry. This tip especially applies to necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>Try searching for sales when purchasing jewelry. You can save big money with the right sale. Use the resources at your disposal like the Internet, newspapers, and even window shopping to find the best sales. If you wait to buy jewelry until that particular style is going out of fashion, you can get it for almost 50 percent off of its original price.</p>
<p>Jewelry that has been cared for properly retains its sentimental and economic value. When you give your valuable jewelry the proper care, you are protecting your investment and cherishing your memories. With the vast amount of information available on jewelry, you may never stop learning how to get the most out of the jewelry you own. By continuing to absorb this information, you can care for your jewelry this way.</p>
<p>This will accent the belt, and will add a lot of visual interest. You can pin it centered at your waist or closer to your hip.</p>

Even a small and inexpensive piece if meaningful. This selection of tips will be useful for anyone who wishes to learn more about different ways to buy, wear or store jewelry.</p>
<p>If you are shopping for sterling <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">silver jewelry</a>, you&#8217;ll need a magnet and an eye for the real thing. When you do this, you become able to find fake pieces of any type of sterling jewelry. You can use the magnet because non-precious metals actually are attracted by magnets. Sterling silver always has some sort of stamp to indicate it is sterling. Silver jewelry that lacks a hallmark may be a fake or composed of other metals.</p>
<p>Store your jewelry collection carefully. Boxes, holders, compartments, and hooks are all valuable tools for storing jewelry safely. Tossing all of your jewelry into the same box is a bad plan. This can harm delicate parts, and tangle some pieces with others, like necklaces.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Be sure to pay attention to details like type of metal and shape. Doing so can help to find the most special piece for the recipient.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Know the type of gem you&#8217;re buying, when you buy it. Natural gems and imitation gems have been joined recently by synthetic gems, making three main categories. While both natural and synthetic stones are still real, imitation is just glass or plastic made to look like the natural stone. Natural stones are found in the earth and are mined out, while synthetic ones are grown in laboratories.</p>
<p>Jewelry should last for years to come. To ensure you are buying a quality piece, refuse to deal with anybody but the most reputable of jewelers. High-quality jewelry items will have superior craftsmanship and pleasing, aesthetic designs. The person selling the piece should know its history, including who made it and the source of the stones. Making sure that it is high-quality will ensure that it lasts forever.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Make sure a piece of jewelry is still in style before you buy it. One of the few things that can enhance the appeal of a lovely piece of jewelry is knowing that it came at a great discount!</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Be sure to at least inquire about the insurance that is available when you buy jewelry from a reputable jeweler. Then, you will have peace of mind knowing it can be fixed or replaced if anything happens.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you like to collect <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a> pieces, become very choosy about each piece&#8217;s condition. While normally is a beautiful investment, a piece of costume jewelry that is in poor condition is not worth buying. Stick to pieces that are in good to excellent condition, as they are the best investments.</p>
<p>Think about how best ways to look after your jewelry. Depending on the metals and stones used in your jewelry, along with how they are set, you will need different maintenance methods. Each piece is individual in its needs so don&#8217;t assume what works well for one piece will work well for all. If you are unfamiliar with the correct way to clean or maintain a piece, consult a jeweler.</p>
<p>When deciding on which <a href="http://jsbrana.pbooksen.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jewelry pieces</a> to buy, look through the sales advertisements. If the sale is a good one, you can save a lot of money. Check ads in the newspaper, on the Internet, and in stores for the best deals. Consider buying something that is out of style to get a better deal.</p>
<p>Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it&#8217;s uncomfortable or doesn&#8217;t hang as well as you hoped. Doing this also helps you see if the jewelery is long lasting or likely to break easily.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> It is important to think about the most effective methods of jewelry care. Not all types of jewelry can be cleaned in the same manner.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Untangling knotted chains can be easy if you know how to do it. While it can be frustrating untangling metal necklaces, consider using plastic wrap. Place the chain in on the plastic wrap and add a few drops of baby oil onto the knots. You would then untangle the necklace using needles. Rinse the necklace off as best you can and gently pat it dry with a soft cloth. Use soap only if it has been approved to not damage your jewelry.</p>
<p>Have a use in mind for every piece of jewelry you buy. You want to ensure that you purchase a piece of jewelry that you will actually wear. When choosing a piece of jewelry, take into account what you will be wearing it with.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling jewelry on the Internet, make sure your depiction of the piece is detailed, clear and eye-catching. As the potential buyer cannot physically touch the piece, this is important so that the jewelry is presented in its best light. Ensure the focus of your pictures is the piece itself.</p>
<p>You will need to take special care when you are buying costume jewelery! A lot of the stones in costume jewelery are glued in and not set in. Take care not to use chemicals or lots of water in an attempt to clean your costume jewelry. Simply wipe it with a damp warm cloth, followed by a soft, dry cloth. This method will keep your costume jewelry stunning and beautiful.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> A brooch is a great accent for your belt, adding eye-catching interest. Think about placing it near your hip or at waist level.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Know your options when shopping for diamonds. Every diamond is unique and has its own flaws. When you see the diamond in person, the flaws, of course, can become much less important. Every jeweler is able to price point differently, depending on the flaw. You can make the most of your investment if you take the time to comparison shop and hunt down the best diamond that falls within your price range.</p>
<p>Buying jewelry sets can be less expensive than purchasing separate pieces of the same value. You may be able to find some really great deals when you purchase sets of jewelry. You could always break the sets up and give them as individual gifts. This way you can have a gift ready for someone months in advance and know that they will like it.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, jewelry is a great gift almost any time. Small pieces of jewelry can be very sentimental. You will be a jewelry expert if you can make meaningful gifts and also take good care of your jewelry. Consider the tips mentioned here and use them to enhance your enjoyment of special pieces of jewelry for years to come.</p>
<p>Before purchasing a gemstone, find out if it has been treated, and if so, how. The various treatments that gems are given means that they need to be cared for differently. You want to avoid putting a solution on jewelry that has been treated, particularly if you do not know whether or not it will hurt the piece.</p>

By reading this article you will learn to recognize the difference between good quality and bad quality. This article will help you to approach any jewelry counter with confidence. Hopefully we will answer some of your burning jewelry questions in the article below.</p>
<h2>Sided Cloth</h2>
<p>Be careful when storing all your jewelry together. Jewelry should be stored in an organized way in a box, a jewelry holder or hung on hooks. Do not ever just throw them in a pile. This can harm delicate parts, and tangle some pieces with others, like necklaces.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Be sure that you understand the kind of gemstone that is in the jewelry that you are purchasing. There are different types of gems, including imitation, natural and lab produced.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Keep your jewelry looking like new by wiping it with a polishing cloth. This is a chemical-free method to maintain the appearance of your fine jewelry. Use this two-sided cloth on your jewelry as though you were cleaning glass. Use a two-sided cloth to clean your jewelry, one for polishing, and the other for shining.</p>
<p>Know the distinctions between kinds of gems before you make a <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jewelry purchase</a>. Gems are divided into three main categories: imitation, synthetic and natural. Imitation gems are made out of glass or plastic; natural and synthetic gems both consist of real gemstone. Natural gemstones are mined, while synthetic gems are artificially grown.</p>
<p>Be sure to at least inquire about the insurance that is available when you buy jewelry from a reputable jeweler. If your jewelry gets damaged or broken, you can come back to the store and have it repaired or replaced. You should also think about getting additional insurance in cause of theft or loss.</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry free of tarnish to make it look its best. Avoid wearing your jewelry near water. Metals will often tarnish or rust when in contact with water. If you are looking to protect your jewelry from the ill effects of water, try applying clear nail polish, just a thin layer, on the piece itself.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> You should always make an effort to properly care for all of your jewelry. Every metal, setting, and stone has different requirements when it comes to care.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Think carefully about what stones you want in your jewelry. You should chose stones that reflect your personality, as well as complement your skin tone. Neutral colored jewelry is nearly always a good buy, because they blend in well with any outfit. Do not buy something that looks nice on the shelf but that you will never use.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for jewelry or know someone who is, consult these tips. Make the most of every jewelry purchase by knowing how to identify a great piece and a great deal. Great taste when it comes to jewelry really just means being fully educated and well experienced in the field.</p>

Jewelry can be a testament to celebrations in a person&#8217;s life and will serve as a memorial to the relationships between two loving people. When you know more about jewelry and its ability to preserve memories, you will find that even the act of buying and selling can be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Be cautious about your jewelry storage. Consider delegating each piece to its own resting place, utilizing compartmental boxes and storage units. Avoiding piling your nice jewelry pieces into one big heap in a box. Not only will your necklaces become hopelessly tangled, you risk harming any fragile pieces as they bump and scrape against each other as you search the box.</p>
<p>Polish your jewelry regularly with a jeweler&#8217;s polishing cloth. This method ensures your jewelry stays shiny without having to use any chemical cleansers or solvents. All you do is polish it like you would a glass with the two-sided cloth. First you should use the polish side, then use the shining side to really make your jewelry look stunning!</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Jewelry should be stored in an air-tight and humid free area. Trying putting them in a box with a tight-fitting lid or a bag that has a drawstring closure. Tarnish is a chemical reaction that happens when silver and other metals are exposed to moisture and air. You will be able to polish precious metals to remove tarnish, but non-precious metals may lose their coating, showing the copper metal beneath.</p>
<p>Having a good eye to catch the details, and a magnet, are key when you are considering the purchase of any type of sterling silver jewelry. You can tell if a piece of silver is sterling or not by using a magnet. Sterling will not react to the magnet, but non-precious metals will be attracted. You will always find a hallmark stamp such as &#8220;.925&#8221; or &#8220;STER.&#8221; on genuine sterling, or alternately, it might simply say, &#8220;STERLING&#8221;. Be wary of jewelery without any kind of hallmark, as often it is fake.</p>
<p>Be careful when storing all your jewelry together. It is best to use holders, compartments, boxes, and hooks so that everything is kept separate. Tossing all of your jewelry into the same box is a bad plan. This can hurt very fragile jewelry, and tangle necklaces or bracelets.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Ask about a jeweler&#8217;s insurance policy before buying anything. If your jewelry gets damaged or broken, you can come back to the store and have it repaired or replaced.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Take the steps to inhibit its tarnishing. Remove your jewelry if you plan on spending time in or near water. Metals can become dull, rusty or tarnished if submerged in it. To protect your jewelry from exposure, apply a single coat of clear nail lacquer to its surface.</p>
<p>Try searching for sales when purchasing jewelry. With the right kind of sale, you can save a lot of money. Keep your eyes peeled for sales on the Internet, in the paper, and on storefront displays. Consider buying something that is out of style to get a better deal.</p>
<h2>Jewelry Online</h2>
<p>If you are wanting to collect costume jewelry, you should ensure you are aware of its condition. While normally is a beautiful investment, a piece of costume jewelry that is in poor condition is not worth buying. A piece of costume jewelry that has been treated well can be a treasure for years to come.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Wear the jewelry piece for a day so that you can get an idea of how comfortable it is and if it hangs right. It will also allow you to test the piece&#8217;s durability.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>It is critical that the photos and descriptions you use to sell <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jewelry online</a> are attractive and high-quality. This is particularly important when selling jewelry online, since the buyer can&#8217;t inspect the piece in person. Don&#8217;t let the background overwhelm the picture.</p>
<p>When you are buying jewelry for someone, it may be a good idea to buy a set instead of just one piece. It is often possible to get a good deal on jewelry sets at a jewelry store. There is nothing stopping you from splitting a set after buying it; you can use a set for a series of gifts over multiple holidays, for example. By doing this, you&#8217;ll always have a gift ready and you know they&#8217;ll like it.</p>
<p>Whether you buy, sell or simply own jewelry, you are making an investment in a commodity that is priceless &#8211; memories. Every piece of jewelry has the ability to carry huge amounts of emotion, whether it is memories of a good time or hope for the future.</p>
<p>To preserve the pristine look of your jewelry, apply your make-up first, wait for it to set, then put on your jewelry. The small particles of powdered makeup can easily dull the shine of your jewelry. This is even more necessary for earrings and necklaces.</p>

Many times, an outfit seems to be missing something that will personalize it and make it a representation of your individuality. The solution is probably good jewelry. You do not need to wear a lot of jewelry to stylize your outfit. Sometimes a simple piece of jewelry is enough to change the overall look of your outfit.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth for all of your jewelry pieces. This is a natural way to shine all of your jewelry without relying on abrasives or other harsh chemicals. All you do is polish it like you would a glass with the two-sided cloth. One side is designed to polish, and the other is used to make the piece shine.</p>
<p>Be cautious of storing all of your pieces of jewelry together. It is recommended to separate the items stored by using compartments, boxes, holders and hooks. Do not just throw them into piles in a box. This can harm delicate parts, and tangle some pieces with others, like necklaces.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Keep jewelry stored safely and away from both air and humidity. To protect your jewelry it is important to secure it in a small bag with a drawstring, or in a jewelry box that remains closed a majority of the time.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you are in the market to buy some silver jewelry, don&#8217;t forget to take a magnet along with you. By using the magnet you can quickly determine if the jewelry item is made of a cheaper metal and not sterling silver. You will always find a hallmark stamp such as &#8220;.925&#8221; or &#8220;STER.&#8221; on genuine sterling, or alternately, it might simply say, &#8220;STERLING&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t see a stamp of any sort on a piece, then be wary of whether it is actually silver or not.</p>
<p>When you <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">buy jewelry</a>, it should last the rest of your life. When choosing jewelry, you should always buy from a reputable store or dealer, in order to ensure you only get high-quality pieces. They should show a lot of craftsmanship, as well as be well-made. The jeweler should tell you about who made the piece and the origin of the stones. You&#8217;ll create an heirloom tomorrow if you choose high-quality jewelry today.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the type of metal they wear, such as white gold or yellow gold. Also notice if your loved one usually wears hoops or studs. This way, you know where you should start when buying a gift.</p>
<p>If you are shopping for sterling silver jewelry, you&#8217;ll need a magnet and an eye for the real thing. If the piece you are examining is not silver and is made from non-precious metal, it will be attracted to the magnet. True sterling silver will also have a mark on it to indicate its quality, such as &#8220;0.925&#8221; or &#8220;ster&#8221;. If you cannot find a stamp, you might be looking at a cheap imitation.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Before you buy a gemstone, ask what type of gemstone it is. There are basically three distinct types: natural gems, synthetic gems and imitation stones.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Prevent your jewelry from tarnishing so that it keeps looking great. Try to keep your jewelry away from water. Lots of jewelry materials are dulled or tarnished by water exposure. To give jewelry an added layer of protection apply a thin layer of clear nail lacquer.</p>
<p>Consider the stones whenever you buy jewelry. Choose a stone that reflects both your personality, skin tone and lifestyle. Colors should be neutral so that they go with most of your outfits. As long as you&#8217;re spending money, it makes more sense to purchase something that is functional as well as beautiful.</p>
<p>Jewelry is an excellent way to accentuate any outfit. Jewelry comes in many styles, from casual to formal, all designed to enhance your appearance. Before you walk out the door, put on a piece of jewelry to make sure you are looking your best.</p>
<p>Quality jewelry should stay beautiful forever. Choose reputable jewelry dealers when considering your next jewelry purchase. A truly high-quality piece is one that is well-constructed and of superior workmanship. A good jeweler can provide you with some background on the piece, such as who crafted it, where it was manufactured, and where any stones in it came from. Put effort into your choice, so you can be sure that the piece will last generations.</p>

Do you have knowledge of the different types of jewelry, and can you recognize the quality of different pieces? You will also learn the difference between man-made or lab created gem and natural gems. Read this article to expand your jewelry related knowledge.</p>
<p>Take care when you are storing your jewelry in the same place. Boxes, holders, compartments, and hooks are all valuable tools for storing jewelry safely. Do not just throw them into piles in a box. Fragile jewelry could easily be damaged by doing this, not to mention the nuisance of having to untangle necklace chains that could get caught together.</p>
<p>When you are putting your jewelry away, take care on how it is stored. Boxes, holders, compartments, and hooks are all valuable tools for storing jewelry safely. Avoid simply piling them on top of each other in a box. Not only will your necklaces get all tangled up, you risk damaging all your fragile and fine jewelry pieces.</p>

<p>Jewelry should be a purchase that truly lasts a lifetime. Get jewelry from a jeweler with a good reputation to be sure that it&#8217;s of high-quality. Any piece that is high quality will have its craftsmanship and quality shining through. A good jeweler can provide you with some background on the piece, such as who crafted it, where it was manufactured, and where any stones in it came from. A quality item of jewelry will last a lifetime or more, so take the time to do your research.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the types, sizes, and colors of jewelry that the person wears. Doing so can help to find the most special piece for the recipient.</p>
<p>When you purchase jewelry from a jeweler, ask about their insurance policy. If your jewelry becomes damaged, you can return it to the source and have it repaired. You should also think about getting additional insurance in cause of theft or loss.</p>
<p>Make sure you know what kind of gem you are getting when you are buying jewelry. Gemstones come in three different varieties: natural, imitation and synthetic. While both natural and synthetic stones are still real, imitation is just glass or plastic made to look like the natural stone. Natural stones are found underground and synthetic gems are created in a lab.</p>

Find a few reference pieces that you like, and see if other diamonds can do better.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>These tips should be followed if you want to make an informed jewelery purchase. You may be able to save a little money. Learn what jewelry to look for, and what the signs of quality are. It doesn&#8217;t take long to educate yourself about jewelry. Soon you will be buying jewelry like a pro.</p>

This article will show you some ways you can get the most from your jewelry purchases.</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry looking like new by wiping it with a polishing cloth. With this method, you can simply shine it up and not deal with the hassle of using cleaners. Buff your jewelry with the two-sided cloth, just as if you were cleaning a glass. Use the side that is designated for polish, and the other to make it shine.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth to keep your jewelry clean and free from damage. This will give your jewelry shine and luster without the use of potentially harmful chemicals. You just have to polish each piece the same as you would polish glass using the two-sided cloth. First, use the polishing side to polish it up, then use the other side to shine it.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Know the type of gem you&#8217;re buying, when you buy it. The types of gems available are synthetic, imitation and natural.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Always keep your jewelry in a place that doesn&#8217;t experience extreme temperatures or humidities. Trying putting them in a box with a tight-fitting lid or a bag that has a drawstring closure. When non-precious and precious metals are expose to air and humidity, they tend to tarnish. It is possible to polish precious metals, but polishing non-precious metals will damage the coating, which makes the copper that metal was covering show.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>
<p>Bring a magnet when shopping for sterling silver jewelery. Jewelry made with non-precious metals will be attracted to the magnet, revealing any fakes. Look for the hallmark stamped on the piece of jewelry to determine what percentage sterling silver it is. If the piece you&#8217;re inspecting doesn&#8217;t carry such a mark, be careful, as it is likely a fake.</p>
<p>If you like to buy costume jewelry, make sure that you examine the condition carefully. This type of jewelry can be extremely expensive and makes an incredible investment. However, this type of piece can have a lot of wear and tear, which wouldn&#8217;t be worth your money or time. Pieces that are in great shape will fetch you better prices down the road, should you choose to sell them.</p>

<p>Always shop around when buying a diamond. Take a look at the diamonds up close, then put it next to other pieces you are interested in. Keep an eye out for deceptive tricks to cause you to think a diamond is better than it actually is.</p>
<p>See what types of earrings they wear, what color, if they wear ankle bracelets, etc. Doing so can help to find the most special piece for the recipient.</p>
<p>Ask about any insurance a jeweler may offer when you are buying jewelry. Then, if something actually happens to the jewelry, you can return it or have it repaired. There are jewelers who offer insurance for misplaced or lost jewelry, too.</p>
<p>Caring for your jewelry properly is important; you should definitely give it some consideration. The variety of stones, metals and assorted settings will determine the ways in which you care for them. A jewelry cleaner that is safe for one type of gemstone may damage another kind. If you are uncertain what the best practice is for caring for a particular piece of jewelry, ask your jeweler.</p>

A one-of-a-kind jewelry piece is a great way to show someone how much they mean to you.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Think carefully about what stones you want in your jewelry. Pick out stones that will reflect your personality and complement your skin tone. If you choose a neutral color it will match anything you wear. Do not buy anything that you cannot wear.</p>
<p>Well-maintained jewelry holds both its resale value and sentimental value. With proper knowledge on how to care for your jewelry, you can keep your memories safe and the value of the jewelry high. There is a lot more information out there, so keep educating yourself so that you will know how to get the most out of your jewelry.</p>

Even the most delicate pieces of jewelry are special gifts that will be appreciated by their recipient. The following article will give you some insight about jewelry, whether you are thinking of buying some as a gift or purchasing a special piece for yourself.</p>
<p>Store your jewelry carefully. Keep pieces separately by using compartments, boxes, hooks and holders. Resist the temptation to jumble all your pieces into a community box. This can hurt very fragile jewelry, and tangle necklaces or bracelets.</p>
<p>Ensure you are certain how to keep your jewelery in one place so it is not damaged. The right jewelry box that has separate compartments, hooks and holders to keep the pieces apart is the best choice. Avoid just throwing them into a box in an unorganized manner. Not only can this harm the fine and fragile pieces, but things like necklaces can get severely tangled up with other necklaces or other jewelry.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Always keep your jewelry in a place that doesn&#8217;t experience extreme temperatures or humidities. Ideally, you should keep them in drawstring bags or in a jewelry box. Precious, as well as non-precious metals, will tarnish if they are exposed to humidity and air over time. While precious metals can be polished back to their original luster, non-precious metals are only coated in which case polishing causes the copper metal underneath to show through.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re considering a diamond purchase, plan on shopping around and making comparisons. Compare the jewelery you like with others that are similar; make sure to examine the pieces closely. There are ways to hide some of a diamond&#8217;s imperfections, so be very particular about each one you view.</p>
<p>Take the steps to inhibit its tarnishing. One of the best ways to keep your jewelry looking beautiful is to avoid wearing it in water. If you let some metals get wet too often, they can tarnish, rust or become dull. If you are looking to protect your jewelry from the ill effects of water, try applying clear nail polish, just a thin layer, on the piece itself.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> You should ensure the quality of the pieces of costume jewelry that you purchase for your collection. Costume jewelry, while expensive, can be a great investment.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Wearing the jewelry yourself can help you decide if it will be appropriate for your intended recipient. You will be able to tell if it will hold up to wear and tear.</p>
<p>Taking good care of your jewelry is important if you want it to last. Different styles of jewelry affect the way they need to be cared for; one type of metal will need a different treatment than another, for example. What works for one material could damage another. If you are uncertain what the best practice is for caring for a particular piece of jewelry, ask your jeweler.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Consider the stones whenever you buy jewelry. Choose stones that complement your complexion and that best reflect your personality. Neutral colors work better to match all your clothing. Buying a stone that you will never wear is pointless</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Consider unique pieces of jewelry for unique individuals. This shows that you are both thoughtful and creative, traits that someone who would want a unique piece of jewelry is likely to value.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p><a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Costume jewelry</a> needs special care. A fair amount of costume pieces are set with glue. Take care not to use chemicals or lots of water in an attempt to clean your costume jewelry. For best results, use a warmed, damp cloth to wipe your jewelry and then use another cloth to dry it. This will ensure that your costume jewelry looks perfect.</p>
<p>For a gift that is as unique as its recipient, look for handcrafted or customized pieces. Finding something that shows you put thought and effort into the gift is more important the the gift itself, so whether or not what you choose exactly what they wanted, they are sure to be pleased.</p>
<p>Ask your jeweler before you make a purchse about what kinds of treatments were used on the gemstones in the piece. It is important to understand the varying treatment processes because each one requires a specific care regimen. For example, you should avoid cleaning a gem that has been treated with a certain solution that could peel off the treatment because this could harm the gem.</p>
<p>By wearing a brooch, your belt will be accented and look more interesting. Pin it near your hip or your waist&#8217;s center.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> In order to make sure your jewelry is always looking clean, you should only put a piece on once you&#8217;ve applied your make-up. Makeup will settle into your jewelry making it look dull and dingy.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you are in the market for jewelry, always seek out sales. You can save huge amounts of money if you are savvy. Check for great sales online, in the newspaper, and even storefront windows. You could get great jewelry at discounts close to 50%, especially when it comes to styles that are being phased out.</p>
<h2>Plastic Wrap</h2>
<p>Untangle your knotted necklaces, even the delicate ones. Don&#8217;t give up on that tangled mass of jewelry. Instead, get a piece of plastic wrap. Put the tangled necklace onto the plastic wrap, then pour a little mineral oil or baby oil onto the piece. Using sewing needles, you should be able to separate the knot. Wash it gently with a bit of dish soap and then pat it dry.</p>
<p>If you are selling your jewelry online, make sure it is presented attractively. An online buyer doesn&#8217;t get the opportunity to handle the jewelry, so photos of the piece have to speak for themselves. Take your jewelry photographs in a manner that focuses only on the piece, not anything in the background, and keep the background very plain.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Think about getting a set of jewelry rather than a single piece. Jewelry in sets comes with a discount at many jewelry stores.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>The size of the diamond is not as important as its cut and clarity. The personal preferences of the individual who will be wearing the diamond are of paramount consideration.</p>
<p>This rule applies to dry saunas as well as steam ones. This is because the extreme heat and moisture can cause serious problems to the piece.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, jewelry is a great gift almost any time. It will mean so much to the person receiving it, even if it is the smallest piece. There are things you should know about how to take care of your own jewelry, too. Either way, take the advice contained here so as to enhance the enjoyment you feel about jewelry.</p>
<p>When you go swimming, take your jewelry off first. Chlorine is a very strong and harsh chemical that can damage and dull your precious pieces. Ocean salt water can similarly cause damage to any jewelry exposed to it. Take off your jewelry before swimming to ensure that it lasts as long as possible before you have to replace it.</p>

No matter the size of the piece, there is nothing more exciting than receiving a piece of jewelry. Read this article to learn some tips about jewelry; whether it be your own or a gift to someone else.</p>
<p>Identify the kind of stone in every piece you consider. A stone may be natural, synthetic or imitation. Synthetic and natural are real stones, while the imitation ones are plastic that is colored. Natural gems are dug up from the ground, and synthetic gems are man-made in a lab.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use acetone, ammonia, turpentine, bleach, or other harsh chemicals for cleaning them. This could cause the stone to change color or become dull in appearance, and it may eat away at the enamel on the piece.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Know which kind of stone you are buying with your jewelry. Gemstones come in three different varieties: natural, imitation and synthetic.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Jewelry should be a purchase that truly lasts a lifetime. Get jewelry from a jeweler with a good reputation to be sure that it&#8217;s of high-quality. Jewelry should display exemplary craftsmanship and be well-made. The jeweler that you purchase the item from should give you the history of the piece, as far as who made it, and, if there are stones on the item, where they came from. It is important that your pieces are high-quality if you want them to last a long time.</p>
<p>Prevent your jewelry from tarnishing so that it keeps looking great. One of the best ways to keep your jewelry looking beautiful is to avoid wearing it in water. Many metals can become tarnished, rusty or dull when exposed to water too often. Clear nail polish, applied in a thin coat, can give jewelry some added protection.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>Take the time to notice what kind of jewelry they already wear. For example, if they wear earrings, are they hoop or studs? Do they prefer white or yellow metals? Knowing their preferences will be an invaluable guide when you go out to buy them a special item of jewelry.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> B</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that you love <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a>, but make sure you evaluate the condition of any piece you plan to buy. Costume jewelry can prove to be a good investment, but worn, broken, or otherwise damaged pieces are not worth the expense. A piece in good condition will be much more resourceful to you in the future.</p>
<p>Consider how you should best clean each piece of your jewelry. Various settings, types of metals, and gemstones need different types of care to protect them and make sure they get cleaned properly. Along the same lines, enhancing different stones and settings requires you to take different steps. Go ahead and ask a professional jeweler to find out exactly how you should be caring for your jewels.</p>
<p>Have a unique piece of jewelry made for the special person on your gift list. You want the piece to match the person; unique people deserve unique jewelry.</p>
<p>Ask about insurance from your jeweler before purchasing a new piece. Many stores offer a policy where you can bring broken or damaged jewelry back to the original jeweler for repair at little to no cost. In certain instances, there may even be jewelry insurance available to cover loss or theft.</p>
<p>A brooch is a great accent for your belt, adding eye-catching interest. Think about placing it near your hip or at waist level.</p>
<p>Apply your makeup before putting on your jewelry. The grime and dust in makeup are attracted to the jewelry, and if you put on the jewelry before the cosmetics, it can cause the pieces to look dull. It is especially important to keep this in mind when putting on earrings and necklaces.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, jewelry can be an ideal gift for more than one occasion. The piece does not have to be over-the-top and ostentatious either, even a small item is guaranteed to please the receiver. Of course, there are things you also need to know to maintain the jewelry you have yourself. Apply the tips from this article to buy and care for your jewelry better.</p>
<p>Be careful when untangling your delicate necklaces. While it can be frustrating untangling metal necklaces, consider using plastic wrap. Put the chain on the wrap, then pour on a bit of mineral oil or baby oil. Use a sewing needle to untangle the necklace. Wash it gently with a bit of dish soap and then pat it dry.</p>

Everything is matching, and you look great; however, the right thing to make the whole outfit look perfect is missing. The solution to your problem is probably jewelry. With even the simplest yet fitting accessory of jewelry, you can start seeing what you wanted in your outfit immediately.</p>
<p>You should expect good jewelry to last the rest of your life, and possibly beyond. When choosing jewelry, you should always buy from a reputable store or dealer, in order to ensure you only get high-quality pieces. Quality jewelry will be constructed to last, and show a fine attention to detail. The person selling the piece should know its history, including who made it and the source of the stones. Choosing a high-quality piece of jewelry is important, so that it will last forever.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use things that contain harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, acetone or turpentine, to clean your jewelry. This will result in damage to both the stones and the metal of the piece.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> To distinguish between real and fake, bring a magnet when you shop for sterling silver jewelry. If the piece you are examining is not silver and is made from non-precious metal, it will be attracted to the magnet.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>To keep your jewelry looking great, take steps to prevent it from tarnish. Remove your jewelry if you plan on spending time in or near water. This could cause your jewelery to rust or become more dull. If you must take your jewelry somewhere wet, prepare it by adding some clear nail polish on the surface.</p>
<p>Think about how best ways to look after your jewelry. Take into account that different types of material takes different types of care, like stones and metals. What works well with one type of precious stone may actually harm another. If you are unfamiliar with the correct way to clean or maintain a piece, consult a jeweler.</p>
<p>An attractive brooch can increase visual interest and accent your waist. To add a twist to tradition, place the brooch at your hip.</p>
<p>Comparison shopping is a must when shopping for diamonds. Get up close to inspect the diamond carefully. Make a comparison with other pieces you have looked at. Look out for tricks that make the diamond look better than it is.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> See what types of earrings they wear, what color, if they wear ankle bracelets, etc. These types of observations will provide a starting point to purchase an item they&#8217;ll cherish.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>One way to ensure that your jewelry stays clean is to put it only after you have applied your make-up and it has had time to set. Any kind of spare dust or oil will attach itself to your jewelry, so putting it on before makeup will just make it look a little dirty. This tip especially applies to necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>It is easy to find jewelry on sale. Buying at the right moment can mean big savings. Check for great sales online, in the newspaper, and even storefront windows. Sometimes, buying fashion styles that are on their way out can save you almost half of the original price.</p>
<p>The diamond cut and clarity can make the stone more appealing than the size. Be sure to consider the type of person that you are presenting the diamond to.</p>
<p>To keep your jewelry looking great, take steps to prevent it from tarnish. When you are close to water, do not wear your jewelry. Water can dull and rust some types of metal if it is exposed to it too often. If you want to give your jewelry a measure of protection from this element, coat it thinly with clear nail polish.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it&#8217;s uncomfortable or doesn&#8217;t hang as well as you hoped. This can also help you see whether the piece is durable enough to last.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Never go swimming while wearing jewelry. Chlorine is a very strong and harsh chemical that can damage and dull your precious pieces. Ocean salt water can similarly cause damage to any jewelry exposed to it. To extend the life of your jewelry, and protect the beauty, take off all jewelry before going into the water.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy jewelry just because of its brand. Nobody will realize where this piece came from, and the seller may sell the piece at a higher price because of this brand. There are thousands of quality brands of jewelry available for purchase.</p>
<h2>Gold Jewelry</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to determine the best approaches for jewelry care. Different styles of jewelry affect the way they need to be cared for; one type of metal will need a different treatment than another, for example. What is beneficial to one stone or setting may hurt another. If you can&#8217;t find information about caring for a specific piece of jewelry, consult a trusted jeweler.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> If you put on your jewelry only after you have put on your makeup, you will have to clean it less. Dust from your makeup can end up on your jewelry, and this can make it look dull.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you want <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gold jewelry</a>, prepare to pay through the nose due to high gold prices. If you decide you must have real gold jewelry, you may want to save money on the karats instead. Gold that is deemed 18 karats contains at least 75 percent pure gold, and many consider this to be the best quality and value for the price.</p>
<p>To complete your address, you will want to find the best piece of jewelery. With so many different kinds of jewelry, you can create a look that is traditional, trendy or polished. So, take advantage of jewelry to accent and accessorize your next outfit no matter where your destination lies.</p>

Even seemingly small gestures will be treasured for years to come. Read this article to learn some tips about jewelry; whether it be your own or a gift to someone else.</p>
<p>Keep your whole jewelry collection sparkling with a polishing cloth. This is a natural way to shine all of your jewelry without relying on abrasives or other harsh chemicals. Simply use the two-sided polishing cloth to polish your jewelry the same way you would polish a glass. Use the one side designated for polish, and the other for making it shine.</p>
<p>Be sure that you understand the kind of gemstone that is in the jewelry that you are purchasing. The three types are imitation, synthetic and natural. Synthetic stones are lab created jewels, while imitation stones are normally colored glass. A natural stone is mined from the earth, and a synthetic is a lab-created gem.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Jewelry should be a purchase that truly lasts a lifetime. It is important to invest in a quality piece of jewelry, so only work with respected and reputable jewelers.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Be careful on how you store all of your jewelry together. Use a box that has several different compartments and hooks to keep your pieces apart. Avoid just throwing them into a box in an unorganized manner. This haphazard approach can cause damage to the individual components of fine jewelry, and create a tangled mess.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Your jewlery needs to be kept in a place where it is protected from air and humidity. Store jewelry in a sealed box or drawstring pouch for the best protection. Continued exposure to humidity extremes or air causes metals typically used in jewelry to tarnish. Precious metals, through some work and polish, can be restored to their original condition. Non-precious metals are coated, which means that polishing will allow copper metal to come through.</p>
<p>Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it&#8217;s uncomfortable or doesn&#8217;t hang as well as you hoped. It will also allow you to see if it can withstand every day wear and tear.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Stones are an important part of jewelry so ensure they factor heavily in your decision. Certain stones will do a better job of complementing your skin tone and your personality than others.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>When shopping for sterling silver jewelry, it is a good idea to bring a small magnet along with you. As a precious metal, silver should never be attracted to a magnet. Sterling silver should always bear a stamp that says Sterling, Ster. or .925. If you cannot find a stamp, you might be looking at a cheap imitation.</p>
<p>Jewelry should last for years to come. When choosing your next piece of jewelry, be sure to deal with a reputable dealer to ensure you attain a high-quality piece. High-quality jewelry items will have superior craftsmanship and pleasing, aesthetic designs. The person selling the piece should know its history, including who made it and the source of the stones. It is essential to purchase high-quality jewelry if you want it to become a treasured heirloom passed down for generations.</p>
<p>Have shopping companions when you shop for diamonds. View the piece you are currently considering closely and then compare it against some other pieces that are in the running. Be careful of tricks that jewelers use to make a diamond look bigger or better.</p>
<p>To keep your jewelry looking clean, only put it on after your make-up is applied and set. Putting jewelry on prior to applying makeup or hairspray allows gunk and grime from your beauty products to settle on the jewelry, leaving it dull and potentially harming the finish. This is especially true when earrings and necklaces are concerned.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Have definite plans for the jewelry you purchase. You don&#8217;t need a box full of unused jewelry.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Before you buy a new piece of jewelry, look at what the current trends are. The only thing that beats getting a new piece of jewelry is getting it for a discounted price!</p>
<p>Keep your jewelry from getting tarnished to preserve its best appearance. Avoid wearing your jewelry near water. Many metals can become tarnished, rusty or dull when exposed to water too often. If you are looking to protect your jewelry from the ill effects of water, try applying clear nail polish, just a thin layer, on the piece itself.</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>This applies to dry and steam-filled saunas. The high heat and humidity in these areas can significantly damage your jewelry.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Comparison shopping is vital to the diamond-buying process. Every diamond is unique and possesses particular flaws.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p><a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Costume jewelry</a> needs special care. These pieces are often put together with glue, which does not last as long as other methods. Therefore, you shouldn&#8217;t get costume jewelry wet or expose it to harsh chemicals. The best way to maintain your costume jewelry is to use a moist, warm cloth first, then dry it off with another cloth. This keeps costume jewelry looking its best.</p>
<p>As you have read above, jewelry is a gift that is great for many occasions. Even smaller, delicate pieces make special gifts that touch the recipient. Of course, there are things you also need to know to maintain the jewelry you have yourself. Apply the tips from this article to buy and care for your jewelry better.</p>

A credible jeweler should offer a complete history of the piece, including information about the creator and the source of the gemstones. When you are looking for jewelry of the highest quality, it is important to be careful in your choice, as you want something that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Keep your jewelry free of tarnish to make it look its best. When you are close to water, do not wear your jewelry.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you wear the piece for 24 hours, then you can be sure that it has been put together correctly and hangs nicely. This will also let you know how the piece holds up in every day environments.</p>
<p>If you put on your jewelry only after you have put on your makeup, you will have to clean it less. The dust, oils and particles from makeup rub off on jewelry; putting on jewels first means they will get dingy and dull with a film of makeup over them. This is particularly important in the case of necklaces and earrings.</p>
<h2>Plastic Wrap</h2>
<p>If you own costume jewelry, it is important to properly care for it. While normally is a beautiful investment, a piece of costume jewelry that is in poor condition is not worth buying. A piece of costume jewelry that has been treated well can be a treasure for years to come.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When shopping for jewelry, think about the stones in the pieces. Choose pieces that have stones which express your personality and those that make you feel great when you wear them.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Take extra care when you are untangling necklaces. Don&#8217;t give up on that tangled mass of jewelry. Instead, get a piece of plastic wrap. Apply baby oil or mineral oil to your necklace after placing it on the plastic wrap. If the jewelry is tangled and knotted, try using needles to unknot the strands. Use a mild liquid soap to remove the oil and then pat dry with a towel.</p>
<p>Before you purchase a new piece of jewelry, consider what situations you will be wearing it in. There is no need to spend your money on a bauble that you cannot see yourself wearing. Think about what type of clothing you will wear with the jewelry before deciding what to buy.</p>
<p>When you want to sell jewelry on the Internet, you should try to show it off in an attractive way. This is extra important because the customer can not handle jewelry with an online transaction. Take pictures of jewelry in an environment that will put the focus on just the piece, not the background.</p>
<p>Know how to keep your jewelry beautiful. You should know that different materials require different maintenance. The best way to care for a particular piece of jewelry could be harmful to a different piece. Talk with a professional if you aren&#8217;t sure what sort of care each jewel requires.</p>
<p>Avoid both steam and dry saunas. This is because the extreme heat and moisture can cause serious problems to the piece.</p>
<p>Men and women alike can get overwhelmed by jewelry at times, be it price, style, care or appropriate occasion. Remember to use these tips to choose jewelery.</p>

Can you identify the diverse qualities and characteristics of different pieces? You will also learn the difference between man-made or lab created gem and natural gems. This article will help you answer some of your jewelry related questions.</p>
<p>Pay attention if they usually wear studs or hoop earrings, white gold or yellow, and any other typical jewelry that they wear. These answers should give you a reasonable starting point for your shopping.</p>
<p>When purchasing sterling silver, take along a good magnifying glass, along with a small magnet. By using the magnet you can quickly determine if the jewelry item is made of a cheaper metal and not sterling silver. There should be a stamp hallmarked that says something like .925 sterling or ster, on sterling silver If there is no hallmark, watch its authenticity since it may be fake.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Have shopping companions when you shop for diamonds. Take a very close look at the piece you like, and then make the comparison to any others on your favorites list.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you can prevent your jewelry from tarnishing, it will surely look much more attractive. Exposure to water can affect the finish, so avoid it. Lots of jewelry materials are dulled or tarnished by water exposure. Applying a very thin covering of clear nail varnish to your jewelry offers an added degree of protection.</p>
<p>Consider the stones whenever you buy jewelry. Pick out stones that will reflect your personality and complement your skin tone. Think about how the stones will work with your style, and pick neutral colors that go with everything in your wardrobe. Buying something that does not work with multiple outfits is pointless.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to determine the best approaches for jewelry care. The variety of stones, metals and assorted settings will determine the ways in which you care for them. What works for a certain kind of stone may not work for another. Consult with a jeweler if you are unsure exactly how to care for your own jewels.</p>
<p>Take good care of your costume jewelry. Many costume jewelry pieces are glued rather than set. Therefore, you shouldn&#8217;t get costume jewelry wet or expose it to harsh chemicals. It is best to have two cloths ready, one warm with water and one dry, to use to wipe your jewelry. This will make your current costume jewelry look great.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When buying jewelry for a one-of-a-kind person, buy them something equally unique. Look for something that fits their personality.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If your &#8220;giftee&#8221; is a unique person, try finding a special piece that is crafted specifically for them. A unique ring, necklace or bracelet conveys respect for and appreciation of the recipient&#8217;s creativity and personality.</p>
<p>Accent a belt with a brooch to add more visual interest instantly. Either put it near your hip or near the middle of your waist.</p>
<p>To preserve the pristine look of your jewelry, apply your make-up first, wait for it to set, then put on your jewelry. Putting jewelry on prior to applying makeup or hairspray allows gunk and grime from your beauty products to settle on the jewelry, leaving it dull and potentially harming the finish. This applies to necklaces and earrings more than anything else.</p>
<p>Having an ornate piece at your waist will naturally draw eyes by adding interest. Pin it to the middle of the waist or close to your hip.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Have a purpose in mind for a piece of jewelry before you buy it. There&#8217;s no sense in spending a lot of money of pieces that you&#8217;ll never wear.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>When photographing jewelry for online sale, you need to make the presentation of the piece as attractive as possible. This is extremely important because the potential buyer can not handle the item that is being sold. Photograph jewelry in a setting that concentrates the viewer&#8217;s attention solely on the jewelry; avoid distracting backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is advisable to use this information for your next jewelry purchase. You&#8217;ll be able to buy the right item for the best price, ensuring you&#8217;ve made the best decision, and that the piece lasts a lifetime. Great taste when it comes to jewelry really just means being fully educated and well experienced in the field.</p>

Depending on the material a piece of jewelry is made of, the price varies greatly for each piece. When a shopper is lacking the knowledge to recognize the appropriate prices for the different materials, they may pay much more than necessary. Read this article to get a better idea of what to buy, and what to pay for it.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>
<p>Do some shopping around when you are looking to buy some diamonds. Take a close look at a truly top notch diamond, and then hold everything else you consider to that standard. Be careful of tricks that jewelers use to make a diamond look bigger or better.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Observe them and see what jewelry pieces the happen to be wearing, such as necklaces, earrings, or rings. Also take note of any metals or stones they seem to prefer.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>A magnet is a useful tool when shopping for jewelry in sterling silver. You are able to detect fake pieces of sterling jewelry with a magnet, as non-precious metals are attracted by the magnet. You can identify sterling silver by its markings, for example &#8220;sterling,&#8221; &#8220;ster,&#8221; or &#8220;.925.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t see a stamp of any sort on a piece, then be wary of whether it is actually silver or not.</p>
<p>When you purchase jewelery ensure you know what you are buying. There are three unique types of stones: imitation, synthetic and natural. While both natural and synthetic stones are still real, imitation is just glass or plastic made to look like the natural stone. Synthetic gems are grown in a lab, natural gems are dug out of the Earth.</p>
<p>Always compare prices before purchasing any diamonds. Always see the piece up close, and compare it critically to any others you&#8217;re considering. However, be mindful that there are fraudulent ways to make the diamond look better than it is.</p>
<p>When buying a new piece of jewelry, be sure to check on the current fashion trends. You will enjoy your jewelery even more if you can get it on sale.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Ask about insurance from your jeweler before purchasing a new piece. These policies dictate whether or not the jeweler will replace or fix your item of jewelry if it is damaged.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Try on a few different stones when you are shopping for jewelry. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color. Choose neutral colors that will easily match any outfit you decide to wear. It&#8217;s a waste of time buying something that you won&#8217;t wear regularly.</p>
<p>Special care is required for costume jewelry. A fair amount of costume pieces are set with glue. Avoid using harsh chemicals on these pieces, and do not immerse them. Simply wipe it with a damp warm cloth, followed by a soft, dry cloth. This keeps dirt from building up and making your jewelry look dull.</p>
<p>If the person you are shopping for is a unique individual, consider choosing a one-of-a-kind piece crafted specifically for them. This means you have taken the time to think about the gift and make it as personal as possible. Customized jewelery will also help you convey the right message.</p>
<p>If you want to collect costume jewelry, concentrate on getting quality peices. Costume jewelry is pricey and can retain its value in many cases, but pieces that are damaged aren&#8217;t worth much and aren&#8217;t worth the time to restore. An item in good condition holds its value better in the long run.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When you are looking for jewelry to purchase, give careful thought to the stones you prefer. Choose stones that have a reflection on your personality and that also complement the color of your skin.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Gems are given chemical treatments in the process of cutting, polishing and setting. When you are thinking of buying, ask what treatment a stone was given. You have to select the type of care for your jewelry depending on its treatment. Treatments can interaction with certain types of cleansing solutions, so doing your research can spare you from a chemistry mishap.</p>
<p>Make sure that you regularly untangle delicate, knotted necklaces. You can easily give up on a knotted mass of metal, but instead grab some plastic wrap. Put the necklace onto a wrap, and place mineral or baby oil on it. Use a sewing needle to untangle the necklace. Wash them using dish soap, and then pat dry them.</p>
<p>The size of the diamond is not always the most critical detail, the cut and clarity are important also. You also need to think about who is going to receive this ring.</p>
<p>Costume jewelry needs special care. Costume jewelry is often put together using glue and other adhesives, unlike stoned that are set using metal. For this reason, costume jewelry should never touch water, and you should avoid using detergents on it. Wiping your jewelry off with with a slightly dampened cloth and then wiping it dry is usually sufficient to keep it clean. This will make your current costume jewelry look great.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> This will accent the belt, and will add a lot of visual interest. Pin it in the center of your waist or towards your hip.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Take the time to shop at several different stores, both online and offline, when considering a diamond <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jewelry purchase</a>. No two diamonds are exactly the same, each will have different flaws. You may not care too much about some flaws if you realize they&#8217;re difficult to discern. And each jeweler will set price differently according to flaws. Don&#8217;t just look at one jewelry shop. Take the time to really look around until you find the best deal possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can take this advice and use it to make your next jewelry purchase a memorable one. You will be able to use these tips to save a good amount of time as well as money.</p>

This article will teach you how to save money when buying jewelry and care for it effectively.</p>
<p>Always keep your jewelry in a place that doesn&#8217;t experience extreme temperatures or humidities. To maximize protection, put your jewelry in a jewelry box or a small drawstring bag. Humidity and air tends to cause precious and non-precious metals to tarnish. You will be able to polish precious metals to remove tarnish, but non-precious metals may lose their coating, showing the copper metal beneath.</p>
<p>When you are putting your jewelry away, take care on how it is stored. Using boxes, hooks, holders, and compartments is very effective for ensuring the pieces stay separated. Avoid simply piling them on top of each other in a box. This can damage the finer and more fragile pieces, and items like necklaces can entangle with each other and other pieces into a big mess.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>
<p>If you want to buy sterling silver pieces, use a magnet and examine the jewelry very carefully. Metals that aren&#8217;t precious will connect to the magnet, signaling that it is fake. You can recognize sterling silver by stamps that say &#8216;.925&#8217; or &#8216;ster&#8217;. If the piece that you are looking at is not hallmarked, this is usually the sign that it is a fake.</p>
<p>When you purchase jewelery ensure you know what you are buying. Gemstones now come in natural as well as synthetic and imitation types. You have to know that imitation refers to colored plastic. Natural gemstones are mined, while synthetic gems are artificially grown.</p>
<p>Take the time to notice what kind of jewelry they already wear. For example, if they wear earrings, are they hoop or studs? Do they prefer white or yellow metals? This way, you know where you should start when buying a gift.</p>
<h2>Quality Piece</h2>
<p>Jewelry should be a purchase that truly lasts a lifetime. When choosing your next piece of jewelry, be sure to deal with a reputable dealer to ensure you attain a high-quality piece. A truly high-quality piece is one that is well-constructed and of superior workmanship. Ask the jeweler what the origin of the piece is, like the maker and the origin of the stones. It is important that your pieces are high-quality if you want them to last a long time.</p>
<p>Before you think about picking up new jewelry, check into what the latest trends are to get a sense of what&#8217;s of value. You will enjoy your jewelery even more if you can get it on sale.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep a piece of jewelry looking fantastic, preventing it from tarnishing is important. Do not wear jewelery around water. Many metals can become tarnished, rusty or dull when exposed to water too often. If you are looking to protect your jewelry from the ill effects of water, try applying clear nail polish, just a thin layer, on the piece itself.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Put on the jewelry to see if it hangs correctly, then wear it for a few hours to test the comfort. Doing this also helps you see if the jewelery is long lasting or likely to break easily.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Keep your jewelry pieces looking beautiful by protecting them from tarnish. Do not wear jewelery around water. Many types of jewelry become dulled or tarnished when they are exposed to water. For added protection for your jewelry, try adding a thin coating of clear nail polish.</p>
<p>Caring for your jewelry properly is important; you should definitely give it some consideration. There&#8217;s an ideal way to clean every different type of setting and stone. Something that may help one piece of jewelry might hurt another one. If you can&#8217;t find proper treatment methods, try consulting with a professional jeweler.</p>
<p>Jewelry that is taken care of is extremely valuable both in monetary worth and sentimental value. By learning what you need to do to properly care for your jewelry, you are working to protect memories and the money invested in it. There is a lot more information you can learn if you just educate yourself and know how to get the most from your jewelery.</p>
<p>The color gemstones are an important consideration when shopping for new jewelry. The stone will look best on you if it is complementary to your skin tone, eye, and hair color. Neutral colored jewelry is nearly always a good buy, because they blend in well with any outfit. Do not buy anything that you cannot wear.</p>

Jewelry holds on to memories of important and happy occasions and pays respect to the owner and giver&#8217;s relationship. As your knowledge of jewelry increases, so too will your appreciation of jewelry.</p>
<p>Polish your jewelry regularly with a jeweler&#8217;s polishing cloth. This is a natural way to shine all of your jewelry without relying on abrasives or other harsh chemicals. All you do is polish it like you would a glass with the two-sided cloth. Use the polishing side first and, then the other side to make your jewelry shine.</p>
<p>Good jewelry will last a lifetime. When purchasing your next jewelry item, focus on buying a quality, well-made piece. A high-quality piece of jewelry should be well-made and show superior craftsmanship. The jeweler you buy it from should be providing you with a provenance on the piece. Details of where it came from, what it is made from and who made it. Investing in a high-quality jewelry piece ensures that you will have a timeless item that will be just as wearable in 20 years as it is today.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Keep jewelry stored safely and away from both air and humidity. To maximize protection, put your jewelry in a jewelry box or a small drawstring bag. Air and humidity can tarnish metals of all types. You can restore the precious metals back to their former glory, but plated jewelry is different. Trying to polish those pieces can reveal the non-precious metals underneath, such as copper.</p>
<p>Ask about insurance from your jeweler before purchasing a new piece. That way, if something were to happen to your jewelry, you can easily bring it back to the jeweler who will fix or replace it. In certain instances, there may even be jewelry insurance available to cover loss or theft.</p>
<p>Ask about insurance from your jeweler before purchasing a new piece. If something happens to your piece, you&#8217;ll know you can take it to the jeweler you bought it from, who will repair it or replace the piece. In some instances, you can even insure your jewelry against loss or theft.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> For jewelry to stay shiny and new-looking, it is important to keep it from tarnishing. Keep your jewelry away from water.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you like to buy <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a>, make sure that you examine the condition carefully. While normally is a beautiful investment, a piece of costume jewelry that is in poor condition is not worth buying. The most useful pieces in your collection are the ones that are in excellent condition.</p>
<p>When buying jewelry, think about what kind of stone would be right. Choose a stone that goes well with your skin tone or the kind of clothes you wear and reflects your personality. Choosing neutral colors can help them match anything you wear. As long as you&#8217;re spending money, it makes more sense to purchase something that is functional as well as beautiful.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that your jewelry stays clean is to put it only after you have applied your make-up and it has had time to set. The dust, oils and particles from makeup rub off on jewelry; putting on jewels first means they will get dingy and dull with a film of makeup over them. It is especially important to keep this in mind when putting on earrings and necklaces.</p>
<p>Put the jewelry on and wear it for a bit so you can describe the comfort and fit. You will also have the knowledge that the piece is not going to fall apart the first time the receiver wears it.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> You should always make an effort to properly care for all of your jewelry. Take into account that different types of material takes different types of care, like stones and metals.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Investigate your gemstone to determine if it has been treated before you purchase it, and what type of treatment it had. Gemstone treatment can affect the type of care the piece needs. If you have a treated gem you should avoid any solution that could damage the gem by stripping the treatment.</p>
<h2>Plastic Wrap</h2>
<p>Get the tangles out of a delicate necklace that&#8217;s in a knot. The first thing you need to do is get a piece of plastic wrap. Lay the necklace out on plastic wrap, then apply baby or mineral oil. Untangle it with some needles. Finally, use dish soap and dry gently with a towel.</p>
<p>Costume jewelry should be treated differently than your other jewelry. That&#8217;s because a lot of the costume settings are not set-in; they have usually been glued. Costume jewelry should never be immersed or make contact with harsh chemicals. Wiping it down with a damp, warm cloth and then drying it with another cloth is the best care for it. This keeps costume jewelry looking its best.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Have a unique piece of jewelry made for the special person on your gift list. A unique ring, necklace or bracelet conveys respect for and appreciation of the recipient&#8217;s creativity and personality.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>It is important to pay attention to how the diamond is cut, and the clarity of the stone. To some people this is more important and appealing than the actual size. You must also consider the personality and preferences of the gift recipient.</p>
<p>It can be very hard to tell a natural ruby or sapphire from a synthetic one. Natural and artificial rubies and sapphires are chemically identical to their natural counterparts, but artificial stones are worth far less. If you are considering purchasing real sapphire jewelery, have an independent jeweler check out the natural content.</p>
<p>One stone that is often forgotten about is Alexandrite, although it looks beautiful when made into a piece of jewelry. This stone actually changes color, depending on the natural light. Alexandrite is most often used in earrings, pendants and rings.</p>
<p>This includes both dry and steam saunas. The amount of moisture and heat can damage the pieces.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When you are purchasing diamonds, do some shopping around. Every diamond is unique and has its own flaws.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>A lot of people have begun to pair silver jewelry with yellow gold jewelry. To achieve this look, you need to wear one piece of jewelry containing both silver and gold. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have a mismatched and outdated appearance.</p>
<p>When buying jewelry, be sure and stay within your budget. A beautiful ring will soon lose its allure if you have placed yourself in a significant amount of debt just to acquire it. Engaged couples who are young and not yet financially sound are better off purchasing an inexpensive starter ring. As they get older, they can upgrade to a ring that fits their improved financial situation.</p>
<p>Each piece of jewelry bought, sold or owned will hold a little spot in your memories for the years ahead. Every piece of jewelry has the ability to carry huge amounts of emotion, whether it is memories of a good time or hope for the future.</p>
<p>Jewelry sets are a great gift item to consider. It is not uncommon for jewelers to offer special discounts on matched sets. You can even divide the pieces and give them to multiple recipients or on multiple occasions. This is a fabulous way to always have a gift that someone will love.</p>

<p>Know the type of gem you&#8217;re buying, when you buy it. There are three unique types of stones: imitation, synthetic and natural. You have to know that imitation refers to colored plastic. Synthetic gems are grown in a lab, natural gems are dug out of the Earth.</p>
<p>Before buying a new item of jewelry, do a little research on recent trends. The only thing better than picking up a gorgeous bauble is getting it on sale!</p>
<h2>Costume Jewelry</h2>
<p>When you are shopping for diamonds, there are ways to compare the stones. Take a very close look at the piece you like, and then make the comparison to any others on your favorites list. There are many ways to make a diamond look better than it really is.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> If you want to start a costume jewelry collection, it is important to be aware of the pieces&#8217; condition. A piece that isn&#8217;t in very good condition won&#8217;t be worth it, and since you may be thinking of an expensive item as an investment, it&#8217;s important to watch for wear and tear.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you own <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a>, it is important to properly care for it. Costume jewelry, while expensive, can be a great investment. However, if a piece shows wear it will lose value. Investing in quality means that you can enjoy the jewelry for many years to come.</p>
<p>Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it&#8217;s uncomfortable or doesn&#8217;t hang as well as you hoped. You&#8217;ll also be able to get a better idea of the piece&#8217;s durability.</p>
<p>Consider how you should best clean each piece of your jewelry. Every metal, setting, and stone has different requirements when it comes to care. Along the same lines, enhancing different stones and settings requires you to take different steps. Your jeweler can give you instructions on proper handling if you are not sure.</p>
<p>Put the jewelry on and wear it for a bit so you can describe the comfort and fit. Doing this also helps you see if the jewelery is long lasting or likely to break easily.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> The color gemstones are an important consideration when shopping for new jewelry. Pick out stones that will reflect your personality and complement your skin tone.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>You can use a brooch to make your belt stand out, since it is sure to be eye-catching. Pin it to the middle of the waist or close to your hip.</p>
<p>Wait until after your makeup is complete and set before putting on jewelry. Jewelry will get grimy from the makeup as you apply it, attracting dirt that will make it look dull. It is especially important to follow this tip for necklaces and earrings.</p>
<p>Before you buy, ask the jeweler if and how the gemstone was treated. You will have to treat different gemstones with different kinds of care. You can easily damage your gem, stripping the former treatment off, by cleaning it with the wrong solution.</p>
<p>Consider how you should best clean each piece of your jewelry. Jewelry is composed of different stones, metals, and settings that all require different care to be properly maintained. What works for a certain kind of stone may not work for another. If you&#8217;re not sure of how to properly care for your jewelry, seek advice from a reputable jeweler.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> For a special and personalized gift, have a jewelry piece custom made for your recipient. This means you have taken the time to think about the gift and make it as personal as possible.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Look for sales when you want to buy some new jewelry. The best sales can offer deep discounts on premium pieces. You will find advertisements for the sales in a variety of media mediums including on the net, in newspapers, and also in the stores themselves. If you buy the older fashions that are from the previous season, you can save a lot of money.</p>
<p>Untangle a delicate necklace easily. Don&#8217;t give up on getting the knots out, instead get a sheet of plastic wrap. Put the chain on the wrap, then pour on a bit of mineral oil or baby oil. You can use needles to unravel them. Wash with dish soap and pat dry.</p>
<p>A small but well-cut diamond with high clarity can look nicer than a bigger diamond of lower quality. You must think of the person who will be wearing the jewelry.</p>
<p>If you put on your jewelry only after you have put on your makeup, you will have to clean it less. Dust and grime from makeup gravitates towards jewelry, and putting on your jewelry first can leave it looking dull or dingy. This applies to necklaces and earrings more than anything else.</p>
<p>Make heads turn with unique crystal or onyx pieces. By being nicer to your wallet, you may get better results.</p>
<p>When adorning yourself with over-sized or prominently displayed jewelry, try contrasting it with clothing that is understated. Wear a solid color or the &#8220;little black dress&#8221; to highlight interesting pieces.</p>
<p>Natural rubies and sapphires are hard to tell apart from their chemically produced counterparts. The chemical and physical composition of natural and artificial stones can be identical, but the man-made ones are manufactured for a small percentage of the price of a natural flawless gem. If you have the least suspicions about a &#8220;natural&#8221; sapphire or ruby you want to buy, get it checked out by a professional gemologist who can detect the inclusions that occur in natural stones.</p>
<p>When making a jewelry purchase, be aware of what you plan to do with it. You don&#8217;t need a box full of unused jewelry. Think about your most-worn wardrobe pieces when choosing jewelry.</p>

<p>Make sure that you increase your knowledge base with regards to jewelry. You now have a better idea of how to select jewelery. If you keep these tips in mind, you&#8217;ll be more successful in your jewelry endeavors.</p>

Do they cry out for the wonderful accents that jewelry can provide? Or perhaps a jewelry piece as a friend&#8217;s present? It is hoped then that you will find this article of handy hints, quite useful.</p>
<p>You never want to use bleach, ammonia, or any other cleaning solvents that are not designed specifically for cleaning jewelry. These can erode both the color and the materials of your jewelry.</p>
<p>Try using a polishing cloth on all of the jewelry in a collection. This is a natural way to shine all of your jewelry without relying on abrasives or other harsh chemicals. Simply use the two-sided polishing cloth to polish your jewelry the same way you would polish a glass. Use a two-sided cleaning cloth, one for polishing and one for shining.</p>
<h2>Sterling Silver</h2>
<p>If you are shopping for sterling silver jewelry, you&#8217;ll need a magnet and an eye for the real thing. If the piece you are examining is not silver and is made from non-precious metal, it will be attracted to the magnet. There should be a stamp hallmarked that says something like .925 sterling or ster, on sterling silver Be wary of pieces that lack any silver hallmarks, as this is an indication that they&#8217;re not genuine sterling silver.</p>
<p>Be sure that you understand the kind of gemstone that is in the jewelry that you are purchasing. Three different kinds of gems are available for purchase: imitation, synthetic and natural. &#8220;Real&#8221; can mean natural or synthetic, and an imitation stone could be glass or plastic. Natural stones are found in mines, while synthetic stones are produced by machines.</p>
<p>When you are purchasing a new piece of jewelry, be aware of the gemstone that it contains and what it is made of. Gemstones now come in natural as well as synthetic and imitation types. Natural and synthetic gemstones are both actual gemstones, while an imitation gemstone is just a plastic mold made to look like a gemstone. Natural stones are found underground and synthetic gems are created in a lab.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Make sure a piece of jewelry is still in style before you buy it. Getting a nice piece of jewelry is good, but getting it at a discount is even better.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Do some price comparisons before you commit to buying a piece of diamond jewelry. Compare the jewelery you like with others that are similar; make sure to examine the pieces closely. You should be aware that there are many deceptive people trying to sell jewelry; therefore, it is essential to learn and understand what is involved when selecting a new diamond.</p>
<p>Before you buy any gemstone, determine what, if any, treatment it received. Depending on the type of treatment used, the piece will require varying types of care. You want to avoid putting a solution on jewelry that has been treated, particularly if you do not know whether or not it will hurt the piece.</p>
<h2>Yourself Wearing</h2>
<p>Try out the jewelery by wearing it for a period of time, like a day, so you can see whether it&#8217;s uncomfortable or doesn&#8217;t hang as well as you hoped. This also helps you to see its durability.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Costume jewelry needs special care. Costume settings are often glued-in as compared to set-in.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>You should always know what you plan on doing with jewelry when purchasing it. There is no need to spend your money on a bauble that you cannot see yourself wearing. As you shop for jewelry, try to envision whether you can see yourself wearing a piece with your current wardrobe.</p>
<p>You can have a more beautiful diamond if it is cut correctly, as opposed to a diamond of a bigger size. Remember to think about the personality and style of the woman you&#8217;re getting the diamond for.</p>
<p>Comparison shopping for diamonds is critical. No diamond is without its flaws, and every piece is unique. Once you see some of the flaws in person, they may become less important. Also, each jeweler can price point a little bit differently based on the flaws. Shop around to find a great, high-quality diamond at an affordable price.</p>
<p>One key thing to remember is to only put your jewelry on after you&#8217;ve applied your makeup. Putting jewelry on prior to applying makeup or hairspray allows gunk and grime from your beauty products to settle on the jewelry, leaving it dull and potentially harming the finish. Earrings and necklaces are the prominent pieces affected by this.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Before you buy, ask the jeweler if and how the gemstone was treated. Different treatments come with different requirements for cleaning and storage.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>If you are looking for jewelry as a gift, consider a set rather than an individual piece. You can often get a better price if you buy an entire set. Split the set for a loved one for every upcoming holiday. This is a fabulous way to always have a gift that someone will love.</p>
<p>If you will follow the above tips and techniques, you will be able to appraise the value of any jewelry that you are considering buying. Buying a jewelry item that is heir-loom quality is a traditional move that will bring you enjoyment years down the road.</p>

No matter the price or size, your jewelry gift will be well received and treasured for many years to come. The following article will give you some insight about jewelry, whether you are thinking of buying some as a gift or purchasing a special piece for yourself.</p>
<p>Keep your whole jewelry collection sparkling with a polishing cloth. This helps keep your jewelry shiny without the need for chemical cleansers, which can damage the pieces. Polish your jewelry with a two-sided polishing cloth as you might buff a lovely glass. One side is designed to polish, and the other is used to make the piece shine.</p>
<p>Store your jewelry collection carefully. A better idea is to keep the pieces separate by using boxes, hooks, compartments or holders. Don&#8217;t just put them in one huge, unorganized pile. This can damage fragile jewelry, and make it difficult to find the necklace you want because it&#8217;s tangled with other pieces.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Don&#8217;t keep your jewelry in open air or someplace with a lot of humidity. Keep your jewelry in a drawstring bag or in a box that is made for jewelry.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Be cautious of storing all of your pieces of jewelry together. You can protect your jeweled investments with hooks, boxes and holders that keep each piece intact and prevent tangles. Avoid just throwing them into a box in an unorganized manner. This can damage fragile, delicate jewelry, and necklaces can become very tangled in other jewelry pieces.</p>
<p>Be sure that you store all of your jewelry safely away from air and humidity. Keep your jewelry in a drawstring bag or in a box that is made for jewelry. Tarnish is a chemical reaction that happens when silver and other metals are exposed to moisture and air. Precious metals can easily be polished, but non-precious metal needs a special polish.</p>
<p>Every piece of jewelry should last you a life-time. Go to a dealer you can trust to make sure you get a quality item at a fair price. Any high-quality jewelry will show superior craftsmanship, and will be well-made. The person selling the piece should know its history, including who made it and the source of the stones. Making sure that it is high-quality will ensure that it lasts forever.</p>
<p>Your jewelry should endure an entire lifetime. Get jewelry from a jeweler with a good reputation to be sure that it&#8217;s of high-quality. Any high-quality jewelry will show superior craftsmanship, and will be well-made. Make sure the jeweler is able to tell you the history of the piece, including who created it and where any stones come from. When you choose a piece of jewelry that is high in quality, it can become a heirloom that will last forever.</p>

Costume jewelery pieces can be expensive but they are not worth the investment if they look too old.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Try wearing the item for a little while to see if it is comfortable and hangs correctly. In this way, you will be able to tell if the item will withstand normal wear.</p>
<p>When buying new jewelry, carefully consider the stones. Choose a stone that reflects both your personality, skin tone and lifestyle. Neutral colors are very versatile, as they match well with any outfit. Non-functional jewelry is just a waste of money as it will sit unused.</p>
<p>Do some research on the best way to clean your particular piece of jewelry. Take into account that different types of material takes different types of care, like stones and metals. A treatment that polishes one stone may scratch another stone. If you can&#8217;t find proper treatment methods, try consulting with a professional jeweler.</p>
<p>Try wearing the item for a little while to see if it is comfortable and hangs correctly. This will also let you know how the piece holds up in every day environments.</p>

Sometimes you may be lost about where to begin.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth to keep your jewelry clean and free from damage. This helps keep your jewelry shiny without the need for chemical cleansers, which can damage the pieces. Use this two-sided cloth on your jewelry as though you were cleaning glass. Use one side for polishing and the other for improving its shine.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use acetone, bleach, ammonia or turpentine to clean copper. Chemicals can eat away the stones or enamel on your stones.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> A good piece of jewelery can last you your whole life. Don&#8217;t buy jewelry from less than reputable stockists if you expect your pieces to be of the highest quality.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Be cautious of the way all of your personal jewelry gets stored together. Using boxes, hooks, holders, and compartments is very effective for ensuring the pieces stay separated. Throwing the jewelry together into the <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jewelry box</a> is a no-no. This can hurt very fragile jewelry, and tangle necklaces or bracelets.</p>
<h2>Precious Metals</h2>
<p>Keep your jewelry in a relatively air-tight container, and minimize its exposure to humidity. Some good examples of proper storage would be,a jewelry box that is closed, or a small draw string bag. Humidity quickly tarnishes both precious and non-precious metal. Precious metals are capable of being polished until they are like new, while non-precious metals will not be able to be saved. This is because the non-precious metals are simple copper metal coated with the covering of precious metals, and when polished, they will allow the copper to show through.</p>
<p>Take the steps to inhibit its tarnishing. One of the best ways to keep your jewelry looking beautiful is to avoid wearing it in water. Water can cause some metals to lose their luster or to become tarnished or rusty. A very light coating of clear nail varnish can be applied to some jewelry, and this will add an additional line of protection against the elements.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When collecting costume jewelry, pay close attention to the condition of any piece you are considering. Well-done costume jewelry is often worth the price, but if it&#8217;s worn out or visibly damaged, it won&#8217;t be worth the effort it takes to restore it.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Find out more about the gems you look at. Ask about where they came from and to which category they belong. Gems are divided into three main categories: imitation, synthetic and natural. Natural gems and synthetic gems are real gemstones, whereas imitation is just an item of plastic with gemstone colors. Natural stones are dug up out of the ground and synthetic ones are grown in a lab.</p>
<p>You need to pay attention to care and maintenance if you intend to build up a <a href="http://jsbrana.gemmo1.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume jewelry</a> collection. Many <a href="http://jsbrana.pbooksen.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">costume pieces</a> are a great investment and can be quite costly, but costume jewelry that has too many signs of wear will not keep their value over time. Costume pieces kept in great condition will enhance your collection much more over time.</p>
<p>Clearly, buying and selling jewelry successfully requires ample amounts of research and effort. We have provided you with some great tips that offer a solid starting point. Use them well and you&#8217;ll be on the way to successful purchases and sales.</p>
<p>When you are buying new jewelery, think about the stones you want to get. Any stones that you choose should go with your skin tone and reflect your personality. Choosing neutral colors can help them match anything you wear. Having a beautiful piece of jewelry is pretty worthless if you cannot wear it.</p>

You could lose a lot of money through easily-avoided mistakes, if you don&#8217;t cultivate at least a little bit of jewelry know-how. These manageable tips will help. You will be able to more easily pick out and keep jewelery pieces looking great if you follow these tips.</p>
<p>Before adding a piece of jewelry to your collection, research current trends. You will enjoy your jewelery even more if you can get it on sale.</p>
<p>Use a polishing cloth to keep your jewelry clean and free from damage. This method ensures your jewelry stays shiny without having to use any chemical cleansers or solvents. Use a two-sided cloth to simply polish your jewelry as if it were composed of glass. The first side is designed to polish, while the other is for adding shine.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When you are putting your jewelry away, take care on how it is stored. Boxes, holders, compartments, and hooks are all valuable tools for storing jewelry safely.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>When buying new jewelry, carefully consider the stones. Choose a stone that goes well with your skin tone or the kind of clothes you wear and reflects your personality. Think about how the stones will work with your style, and pick neutral colors that go with everything in your wardrobe. A piece that is hard to wear is not as useful as one that goes with everything.</p>
<p>It is important to think about the most effective methods of jewelry care. Each kind of setting, metal, and stone has its own particular maintenance need. A jewelry cleaner that is safe for one type of gemstone may damage another kind. Ask a jeweler when you do not know how to take care of your jewelry.</p>
<p>Your belt will get a little pizzazz if you accent it with a brooch like this. Place the brooch close to your hip or in the middle of your waist.</p>
<p>Before committing yourself to a piece, do research to determine which styles are hot and which are not. The only thing that can make picking out a fantastic piece of jewelry better is if you get it at a discount.</p>
<h2>Plastic Wrap</h2>
<p>It is possible to remove the knots from jewelry that has become tangled. Don&#8217;t give up on getting the knots out, instead get a sheet of plastic wrap. Put the necklace on the plastic wrap and add a little mineral oil or baby oil. Use small needles to untangle the necklaces. Clean with warm, soapy water and gently pat dry.</p>
<p>This includes both dry and steam saunas. This is because the extreme heat and moisture can cause serious problems to the piece.</p>
<p>Ask your jeweler before you make a purchse about what kinds of treatments were used on the gemstones in the piece. You have to select the type of care for your jewelry depending on its treatment. Knowing the proper care techniques for your gemstone will prevent you from accidentally damaging it by stripping it of its protective treatment.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> When you are looking for new jewelry, the first thing to do is to check what is on sale. Finding a store offering extreme markdowns is a way to realize tremendous savings.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Take your jewelry off before you go swimming. Swimming pools contain chlorine, which can age many types of jewelry prematurely. The cumulative effects of salt water can affect jewelery just as badly. Take off your jewelry before diving in the water to keep them looking their best.</p>
<p>Brand name should not be the primary concern when buying jewelry. Very few people will recognize where you got this piece, and if a seller can have you buy something because of the brand, you are probably paying too much for it. Excellent quality can be found from a lot of different jewelry brands.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s easy when you know how. This article has just touched on a few of things that you should know about this very rewarding hobby. There is much to learn, but at least you&#8217;ve now got a few good ideas to put to work.</p>
<p>Be careful when untangling your delicate necklaces. It&#8217;s easy to give up on some knotted metal mass; however, you should instead use plastic wrap. Put the necklace on the plastic wrap and cover it with a little baby oil. Using sewing needles, you should be able to separate the knot. Clean with warm, soapy water and gently pat dry.</p>

If you lack even one key piece of knowledge, it can cost you dearly. Here are some great tips about jewelry. You will be able to more easily pick out and keep jewelery pieces looking great if you follow these tips.</p>
<p>Take a moment to consider how your valuable jewelry is stored and sorted. Use a box that has several different compartments and hooks to keep your pieces apart. You should never simply throw your jewelry into a box in a messy pile. Heavy pieces should not be placed in the same compartment with fragile pieces.</p>
<p>You never want to use bleach, ammonia, or any other cleaning solvents that are not designed specifically for cleaning jewelry. This can dull your stones and eat away their enamel.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: left; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> Do some shopping around when you are looking to buy some diamonds. Always see the piece up close, and compare it critically to any others you&#8217;re considering.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>Pay attention to the type of metal they wear, such as white gold or yellow gold. Also notice if your loved one usually wears hoops or studs. This will help you get started in your search for the perfect item of jewelry for your loved one.</p>
<p>Inquire about insurance for your jewelry when you purchase it from a jeweler. These policies dictate whether or not the jeweler will replace or fix your item of jewelry if it is damaged. Some jewelers even offer insurance for jewelry pieces that have been misplaced or stolen.</p>
<p>Apply your makeup and let it set before putting on jewelry. The grime and dust in makeup are attracted to the jewelry, and if you put on the jewelry before the cosmetics, it can cause the pieces to look dull. This is even more necessary for earrings and necklaces.</p>
<p>When purchasing jewelry from a respected jeweler, inquire as to whether they offer an insurance policy. This is so that if something happens to your piece, you can return it to have it replaced or repaired. There are even some jewelers that will cover the replacement if the piece has been lost or stolen.</p>
<p><DIV style='float: right; width: 150px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;'><DIV style='background-color: #FFFFCC; color: #000000;'><small><font color='#FF0000'><b>TIP!</b></font> You should carefully consider how to best care for your jewelry. Different metals, stones, and settings have different needs to ensure proper maintenance.</small></DIV></DIV></p>
<p>When you are looking for new jewelry, the first thing to do is to check what is on sale. If you find the right sale, you might see a lot of savings. Keep your eyes peeled for sales on the Internet, in the paper, and on storefront displays.
